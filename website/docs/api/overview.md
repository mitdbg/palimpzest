This section contains the full documentation for the major classes and methods in PZ.

Our documentation is separated into the following categories:

- `Dataset`: `pz.Dataset` and all user-facing operator methods.
- `Data`: all classes involved in reading, representing, and storing data in PZ.
- `Operators`: the physical operators used internally by PZ.
- `Optimization`: all classes involved with optimization.

These pages are still a work in progress, so please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dN85JJ6jaH) if there is missing documentation that you would like to see!
