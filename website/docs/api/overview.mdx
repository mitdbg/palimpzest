Please see our [User Guides](user-guide/overview.mdx) for documentation on how to use Palimpzest.

In the future, this page will link to developer documentation for those interested in contributing to Palimpzest!

If you wish to contribute to PZ and have questions about specific classes or interfaces, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dN85JJ6jaH).
{/*
This section contains the full documentation for the major classes and methods in PZ.

Our documentation is separated into the following categories:

- `Dataset`: `pz.Dataset` and all user-facing operator methods.
- `Data`: all classes involved in reading, representing, and storing data in PZ.
- `Operators`: the physical operators used internally by PZ.
- `Optimization`: all classes involved with optimization.

These pages are still a work in progress, so please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dN85JJ6jaH) if there is missing documentation that you would like to see!
