{/* ## Goal
This page should provide the reader with a brief overview of the various operators provided to them.

Key takeaways for the reader should include:

1. Seeing an example of each operator in action.
2. Understanding the difference between semantic and non-semantic operators
3. Having a general awareness of the inputs required by each operator (e.g. column specifications for `sem_add_columns()`)

Keeping in line with "show don't tell", this page should have a motivating use case (or two) which evolve(s) in a manner that gradually incorporates each operator one-at-a-time. (If it's too difficult to come up with one example that uses all operators, then try to at least fit the most important operators -- `sem_add_columns()`, `filter()`, `retrieve()` -- into a single example. Additional examples can be created to showcase the other operators.)

PZ provides a variety of semantic operators that leverage large language models (LLMs) to perform data processing tasks. These operators can be broadly categorized into semantic and non-semantic (i.e. "relational") operators.

We provide a discussion and example(s) for using each of the semantic operators provided by PZ, before finishing with an overview of the relational operators.
