title: Overview

<!-- ## Goal
This page should contain a brief overview of what the user guide will teach the reader, with direct links to each section of the user guide.

User guides should probably cover:

- How to read your own data (i.e. custom and standard `Dataset`)
- How to use each operator in PZ (i.e. an overview of all operators)
- How to use the optimizer (halfway between a light introduction and a deep-dive)
- And more, but let's try to keep the number as small as possible (prevent cognitive overload and reader fatigue) -->

Our User Guide is designed to help new users get familiar with PZ at a deeper level than our [Quick Start Tutorial](../getting-started/quickstart.md).

In particular, we will provide you with a deeper understanding of:

- [How to read your own data](../user-guide/dataset.md) (coming soon!)
- [An overview of all operators in PZ](../user-guide/operators.md) (coming soon!)
- [A primer on optimization](../user-guide/optimization.md) (coming soon!)
