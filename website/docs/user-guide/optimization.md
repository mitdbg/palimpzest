title: Optimization

<!-- ## Goal
This page should provide the reader with a brief overview of the PZ optimizer, and -- more importantly -- demonstrate how they can interact with and control the optimization process.

Key takeaways for the reader should include:

1. Having a very basic understanding of what the optimizer does
    - (Without scaring the user) I want to leave them with the impression that the optimizer is doing "real work" which provides value to them
2. Knowing how to provide validation data to the optimizer
3. Knowing how to examine the plan output by the optimizer
4. Having a very basic understanding of how to pass hyperparameters to constrain the optimizer's search

Keeping in line with "show don't tell", this page should have a motivating use case for which the user calls `plan = dataset.optimize()` and prints the resulting `plan`. We should then show how to construct e.g. 3 validation examples for the program, feed them into another call to `dataset.optimize()`, and print the new `plan` (ideally showing that it is more optimal).

Finally, for (4.) we can show how to limit the optimizer's access to specific models (using the `avaiable_models` config option) ***for all operators***. In the near future, we may want to do some engineering to support per-operator limits on models. (Of course, we don't want users feeling like they have to tinker with the `Optimizer` too much. However, I think most new users will gravitate towards restricting models and customizing prompts -- and we should support this in the near term.) -->

Coming Soon!
