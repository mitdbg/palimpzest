title: Overview

{/* ## Goal
This page should contain a brief overview of what the user guide will teach the reader, with direct links to each section of the user guide.

User guides should probably cover:

- How to read your own data (i.e. custom and standard `Dataset`)
- How to use each operator in PZ (i.e. an overview of all operators)
- How to use the optimizer (halfway between a light introduction and a deep-dive)
- And more, but let's try to keep the number as small as possible (prevent cognitive overload and reader fatigue)*/}

Our User Guide is designed to help new users get familiar with PZ at a deeper level than our [Quick Start Tutorial](getting-started/quickstart.mdx).

In particular, we will provide you with a deeper understanding of:

- [How to Create Your Own Dataset](user-guide/dataset.mdx)
- [An overview of all operators in PZ](user-guide/operators/overview.mdx)
- [A primer on optimization](user-guide/optimization.mdx)
