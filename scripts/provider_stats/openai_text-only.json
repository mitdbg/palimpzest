According to the WILDLIFE CONSERVATION & RESEARCH CENTER: SPECIES IDENTIFICATION MANUAL, elephants are known for having trunks and large ears. Specifically, the African Savanna Elephant is noted for having larger ears shaped like Africa and making trumpeting sounds. The description matches the characteristics of an elephant, but it does not specify the type of elephant. However, the mention of \"big ears\" and \"trumpeting sound\" is a strong indicator of an elephant in general.\n\nANSWER:\n{\n  \"animal\": \"Elephant\"\n}\n---",

Elephants are known for their large size, gray color, and distinctive trunk. The trumpeting sound is a vocalization associated with elephants. The manual lists three types of elephants: African Savanna Elephant, African Forest Elephant, and Asian Elephant. The description of \"big ears\" suggests it is more likely an African Savanna Elephant, as they have larger ears compared to the other types. However, since the text does not specify the shape of the ears or other distinguishing features, we can generally identify the animal as an elephant.\n\nANSWER:\n{\n  \"animal\": \"Elephant\"\n}\n---",
