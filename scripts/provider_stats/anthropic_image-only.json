According to the manual:\n- African Savanna Elephant: Weight 5,000-14,000 lbs, height approximately 3.5-4 ft at shoulder (this seems to be an error in the manual for \"Big Cats\" - elephants are much taller)\n- The height of ~304 cm (10 ft) is consistent with an African Savanna Elephant\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the large ear size (shaped like the African continent), the overall body structure, and the height measurement, this is most likely an **African Savanna Elephant**.\n\nANSWER:\n{\n  \"animal\": \"African Savanna Elephant\"\n}\n---",
