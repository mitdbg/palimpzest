According to the manual:\n   - African Savanna Elephant: 3.5-4 ft at shoulder (this seems to be an error in the manual for lions; elephants are much taller)\n   - Asian Elephant: Generally smaller than African elephants\n   - The provided height of ~3 meters is consistent with an adult elephant\n\n3. **Image analysis**: The image shows an elephant with:\n   - Very large ears that are broad and fan-shaped\n   - A concave (dipped) back line\n   - Two visible tusks\n   - Gray/brown coloration\n   - The ear shape appears large and somewhat resembles the African continent shape\n\n4. **Species determination**: According to Section 2.1 of the manual:\n   - **African Savanna Elephant**: Larger ears (shaped like Africa), concave back, two fingers on trunk tip\n   - **Asian Elephant**: Smaller ears, convex back, one finger on trunk tip, twin domes on head\n\nThe large ears, concave back visible in the image, and the overall size are consistent with an **African Savanna Elephant** (or simply African Elephant).\n\nANSWER:\n{\n  \"animal\": \"African Savanna Elephant\"\n}\n---",

The text describes \"a large gray animal with a trunk and big ears\" that \"makes a trumpeting sound.\"\n2. According to Section 2.1 of the manual, elephants are characterized by:\n   - Large size\n   - Trunks\n   - Large ears\n   - Trumpeting vocalizations (alarm/excitement)\n3. The image shows an elephant with very large ears that appear to be shaped somewhat like the African continent, which according to the manual indicates an African Savanna Elephant.\n4. The height is given as 304.5 cm (approximately 10 feet at the shoulder), which is consistent with elephant dimensions.\n5. The age is 15 years, which is within the typical lifespan of elephants.\n6. The animal in the image has visible tusks and the characteristic trunk with what appears to be two finger-like projections at the tip (though not clearly visible in this angle), gray coloration, and very large ears.\n\nBased on the text description mentioning \"trunk and big ears\" with \"trumpeting sound,\" combined with the image showing a large elephant with prominent ears, the species is clearly an elephant. More specifically, based on the ear size and shape visible in the image, this appears to be an African Savanna Elephant.\n\nANSWER:\n{\n  \"animal\": \"African Savanna Elephant\"\n}\n---",
