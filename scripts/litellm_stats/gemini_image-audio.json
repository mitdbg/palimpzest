The audio recording contains a trumpeting sound, which is a known vocalization for elephants. According to Section 2.1 of the manual, the \"African Savanna Elephant\" is characterized by \"Larger ears (shaped like Africa)\" and a \"concave back.\" The manual also lists \"Trumpeting (alarm/excitement)\" as an elephant vocalization. The estimated height of 304.5 cm (approximately 10 feet) is consistent with the large stature of an African Savanna Elephant. These characteristics strongly match the description of an African Savanna Elephant, differentiating it from African Forest Elephants (smaller stature, oval ears) and Asian Elephants (smaller ears, convex back).\n\nANSWER:\n{\n  \"animal\": \"African Savanna Elephant\"\n}",
