Weight: 5,000-14,000 lbs.\n- **African Forest Elephant**: Smaller stature, oval-shaped ears, straighter tusks pointing downward.\n- **Asian Elephant**: Smaller ears, convex back, one finger on trunk tip, twin domes on head. Weight: 4,000-11,000 lbs.\n\n**Step 3: Match observed features**\nThe animal in the image has:\n- Large ears shaped like Africa \u2713\n- Concave back \u2713\n- Large tusks \u2713\n- Large body size consistent with the weight range\n\n**Step 4: Consider the height measurement**\nThe provided height is 304.5 cm (approximately 10 feet), which is consistent with the shoulder height of an African Savanna Elephant (3.5-4 ft mentioned for lions, but elephants are much larger - typically 10-13 feet at shoulder).\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the large Africa-shaped ears, concave back, and size, this is an **African Savanna Elephant**.\n\nANSWER:\n{\n  \"animal\": \"African Savanna Elephant\"\n}\n---",
