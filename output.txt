dependence of longitudinal magnetoresistance and magnetoconductance of ZrTe5 T at = 2 K. NLMR for negative strains (A) and positive strains (B)measured relative to Dmin, corresponding to the STI and WTI phases, respectively. The negative magnetoresistanceSingle-crystal ZrTe5 was grown with the flux method (21). Zr slugs ZrTe5 (99.9% pure, Alfa Aesar) and Te shot (99.9999% pure, Alfa Aesar) wereloaded into a quartz ampule in a Zr:Te ratio of 1:100. The ampule was warmed to 900°C in 9 hours, kept at 900°C for 72 hours, and then cooled to 505°C in 48 hours. To promote large crystal growth, the ampule was repetitively cooled to 440°C and warmed to 505°C. Last, the ampule was cooled to 460°C and decanted in a centrifuge at this temperature.dimensions 1.5 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.02 mm were sputtered 25-mm-diameter
