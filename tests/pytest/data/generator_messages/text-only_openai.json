Your task is to generate a JSON object which fills in the output fields with the correct values.\nYou will be provided with a description of each input field and each output field. All of the fields in the output JSON object can be derived using information from the context.\n\nThe user has additionally provided you with this description of the task you need to perform:\n\nWILDLIFE CONSERVATION & RESEARCH CENTER: SPECIES IDENTIFICATION MANUAL (v2025.1)\n\nSECTION 1: INTRODUCTION AND MISSION\nThe Wildlife Conservation & Research Center (WCRC) is dedicated to the preservation, study, and rehabilitation of diverse wildlife species.\nAll staff members, researchers, and volunteers must adhere to these protocols for accurate species identification and data collection.\nOur mission combines advanced biological sciences with conservation efforts to protect endangered and threatened populations worldwide.\n\nSECTION 2: MAMMAL IDENTIFICATION PROTOCOLS\n\n2.1 ELEPHANTS (Family Elephantidae):\n    - African Savanna Elephant: Larger ears (shaped like Africa), concave back, two fingers on trunk tip. Weight: 5,000-14,000 lbs.\n    - African Forest Elephant: Smaller stature, oval-shaped ears, straighter tusks pointing downward.\n    - Asian Elephant: Smaller ears, convex back, one finger on trunk tip, twin domes on head. Weight: 4,000-11,000 lbs.\n    - Vocalizations: Trumpeting (alarm/excitement), rumbling (long-distance communication), roaring (distress).\n\n2.2 BIG CATS (Family Felidae):\n    - Lion (Panthera leo): Tawny coat, males have distinctive mane. Social, live in prides. Height: 3.5-4 ft at shoulder.\n    - Tiger (Panthera tigris): Orange coat with black stripes, white underbelly. Solitary hunters. Largest cat species.\n    - Leopard (Panthera pardus): Golden-yellow coat with rosette patterns. Excellent climbers, often cache prey in trees.\n    - Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus): Spotted coat, black \"tear marks\" from eyes to mouth. Fastest land animal (70 mph).\n    - Vocalizations: Roaring (lions, tigers, leopards), chirping/purring (cheetahs cannot roar).\n\n2.3 BEARS (Family Ursidae):\n    - Brown Bear (Ursus arctos): Large shoulder hump, dish-shaped face, long claws. Includes grizzly subspecies.\n    - Black Bear (Ursus americanus): Straight facial profile, no shoulder hump, shorter claws. Most common North American bear.\n    - Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus): White fur, longer neck, smaller ears. Marine mammal adapted to Arctic conditions.\n    - Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca): Black and white coloring, feeds almost exclusively on bamboo.\n    - Vocalizations: Roaring, growling, huffing, jaw-popping (threat displays).\n\n2.4 PRIMATES (Order Primates):\n    - Gorilla: Largest primate, silver-back males, knuckle-walking locomotion. Vocalizations include chest-beating, hooting.\n    - Chimpanzee: Highly intelligent, uses tools, complex social structures. Vocalizations: pant-hoots, screams.\n    - Orangutan: Red-orange fur, arboreal lifestyle, solitary. Long calls can travel over 1 km.\n    - Gibbon: Smaller apes, brachiation locomotion, distinctive whooping songs for territorial marking.\n\nSECTION 3: BIRD IDENTIFICATION PROTOCOLS\n\n3.1 RAPTORS (Order Accipitriformes/Falconiformes):\n    - Bald Eagle: White head and tail, yellow beak. Wingspan: 6-7.5 ft. Call: high-pitched chattering.\n    - Golden Eagle: Dark brown plumage, golden nape. Powerful hunters of small mammals.\n    - Peregrine Falcon: Blue-gray back, barred underparts. Fastest bird in dive (240+ mph).\n    - Red-tailed Hawk: Brown back, pale underparts, distinctive red tail. Most common North American hawk.\n\n3.2 PARROTS (Order Psittaciformes):\n    - Macaw: Large, colorful, long tail feathers. Powerful curved beaks. Highly social and vocal.\n    - African Grey: Gray plumage, red tail. Exceptional mimicry and cognitive abilities.\n    - Cockatoo: White or pink plumage, distinctive crest. Loud screeching vocalizations.\n\nSECTION 4: REPTILE IDENTIFICATION PROTOCOLS\n\n4.1 CROCODILIANS (Order Crocodilia):\n    - American Alligator: Broad, U-shaped snout, dark coloration. Freshwater habitats.\n    - Nile Crocodile: V-shaped snout, aggressive. Can reach 16-18 ft in length.\n    - Gharial: Extremely narrow snout, fish-eating specialist.

Semi-aquatic.\n    - King Cobra: Longest venomous snake (up to 18 ft), distinctive hood when threatened.\n\nSECTION 5: DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\n\n5.1 Visual Identification:\n    - Document body shape, size, coloration, and distinctive markings.\n    - Note behavioral characteristics and habitat context.\n    - Use standardized photography protocols for pattern matching.\n\n5.2 Audio Identification:\n    - Record vocalizations with frequency analysis equipment.\n    - Tag recordings with behavioral context (territorial, mating, alarm, social).\n    - Cross-reference with vocalization databases for species confirmation.\n\n5.3 Biometric Data:\n    - Record body measurements according to species-specific protocols.\n    - Document age indicators (teeth wear, plumage, etc.).\n    - Collect genetic samples when possible for lineage verification.\n\nYou are an AI Research Assistant for the WCRC. Your job is to analyze data inputs (text descriptions, images, and/or audio recordings) and identify the species based on the characteristics described in this manual.\nAnalyze all provided inputs and determine the most likely species identification.\n\n\nRemember, your answer must be a valid JSON dictionary. The dictionary should only have the specified output fields. Finish your response with a newline character followed by ---\n---\nINPUT FIELDS:\n- text: Description of an animal\n- age: The age of the animal in years\n\nOUTPUT FIELDS:\n- animal: The animal in the input\n\nCONTEXT:\n{\n  \"text\": \"An elephant is a large gray animal with a trunk and big ears. It makes a trumpeting sound.\",\n  \"age\": 15\n}\n\nLet's think step-by-step in order to answer the question.\n\nREASONING: "
