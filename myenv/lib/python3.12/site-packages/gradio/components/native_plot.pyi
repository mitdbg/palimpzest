        Parameters:
            value: The pandas dataframe containing the data to display in the plot.
            x: Column corresponding to the x axis. Column can be numeric, datetime, or string/category.
            y: Column corresponding to the y axis. Column must be numeric.
            color: Column corresponding to series, visualized by color. Column must be string/category.
            title: The title to display on top of the chart.
            x_title: The title given to the x axis. By default, uses the value of the x parameter.
            y_title: The title given to the y axis. By default, uses the value of the y parameter.
            color_title: The title given to the color legend. By default, uses the value of color parameter.
            x_bin: Grouping used to cluster x values. If x column is numeric, should be number to bin the x values. If x column is datetime, should be string such as "1h", "15m", "10s", using "s", "m", "h", "d" suffixes.
            y_aggregate: Aggregation function used to aggregate y values, used if x_bin is provided or x is a string/category. Must be one of "sum", "mean", "median", "min", "max".
            color_map: Mapping of series to color names or codes. For example, {"success": "green", "fail": "#FF8888"}.
            height: The height of the plot in pixels.
            x_lim: A tuple or list containing the limits for the x-axis, specified as [x_min, x_max]. If x column is datetime type, x_lim should be timestamps.
            y_lim: A tuple of list containing the limits for the y-axis, specified as [y_min, y_max].
            x_label_angle: The angle of the x-axis labels in degrees offset clockwise.
            y_label_angle: The angle of the y-axis labels in degrees offset clockwise.
            x_axis_labels_visible: Whether the x-axis labels should be visible. Can be hidden when many x-axis labels are present.
            caption: The (optional) caption to display below the plot.
            sort: The sorting order of the x values, if x column is type string/category. Can be "x", "y", "-x", "-y", or list of strings that represent the order of the categories.
            tooltip: The tooltip to display when hovering on a point. "axis" shows the values for the axis columns, "all" shows all column values, and "none" shows no tooltips. Can also provide a list of strings representing columns to show in the tooltip, which will be displayed along with axis values.
            height: The height of the plot in pixels.
            label: The (optional) label to display on the top left corner of the plot.
            show_label: Whether the label should be displayed.
            container: If True, will place the component in a container - providing some extra padding around the border.
            scale: relative size compared to adjacent Components. For example if Components A and B are in a Row, and A has scale=2, and B has scale=1, A will be twice as wide as B. Should be an integer. scale applies in Rows, and to top-level Components in Blocks where fill_height=True.
            min_width: minimum pixel width, will wrap if not sufficient screen space to satisfy this value. If a certain scale value results in this Component being narrower than min_width, the min_width parameter will be respected first.
            every: Continously calls `value` to recalculate it if `value` is a function (has no effect otherwise). Can provide a Timer whose tick resets `value`, or a float that provides the regular interval for the reset Timer.
            inputs: Components that are used as inputs to calculate `value` if `value` is a function (has no effect otherwise). `value` is recalculated any time the inputs change.
            visible: Whether the plot should be visible.
            elem_id: An optional string that is assigned as the id of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            elem_classes: An optional list of strings that are assigned as the classes of this component in the HTML DOM. Can be used for targeting CSS styles.
            render: If False, component will not render be rendered in the Blocks context. Should be used if the intention is to assign event listeners now but render the component later.
            key: if assigned, will be used to assume identity across a re-render. Components that have the same key across a re-render will have their value preserved.

        Parameters:
            fn: the function to call when this event is triggered. Often a machine learning model's prediction function. Each parameter of the function corresponds to one input component, and the function should return a single value or a tuple of values, with each element in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
            inputs: list of gradio.components to use as inputs. If the function takes no inputs, this should be an empty list.
            outputs: list of gradio.components to use as outputs. If the function returns no outputs, this should be an empty list.
            api_name: defines how the endpoint appears in the API docs. Can be a string, None, or False. If False, the endpoint will not be exposed in the api docs. If set to None, will use the functions name as the endpoint route. If set to a string, the endpoint will be exposed in the api docs with the given name.
            scroll_to_output: if True, will scroll to output component on completion
            show_progress: how to show the progress animation while event is running: "full" shows a spinner which covers the output component area as well as a runtime display in the upper right corner, "minimal" only shows the runtime display, "hidden" shows no progress animation at all
            queue: if True, will place the request on the queue, if the queue has been enabled. If False, will not put this event on the queue, even if the queue has been enabled. If None, will use the queue setting of the gradio app.
            batch: if True, then the function should process a batch of inputs, meaning that it should accept a list of input values for each parameter. The lists should be of equal length (and be up to length `max_batch_size`). The function is then *required* to return a tuple of lists (even if there is only 1 output component), with each list in the tuple corresponding to one output component.
            max_batch_size: maximum number of inputs to batch together if this is called from the queue (only relevant if batch=True)
            preprocess: if False, will not run preprocessing of component data before running 'fn' (e.g. leaving it as a base64 string if this method is called with the `Image` component).
            postprocess: if False, will not run postprocessing of component data before returning 'fn' output to the browser.
            cancels: a list of other events to cancel when this listener is triggered. For example, setting cancels=[click_event] will cancel the click_event, where click_event is the return value of another components .click method. Functions that have not yet run (or generators that are iterating) will be cancelled, but functions that are currently running will be allowed to finish.
            every: continously calls `value` to recalculate it if `value` is a function (has no effect otherwise). Can provide a Timer whose tick resets `value`, or a float that provides the regular interval for the reset Timer.
            trigger_mode: if "once" (default for all events except `.change()`) would not allow any submissions while an event is pending. If set to "multiple", unlimited submissions are allowed while pending, and "always_last" (default for `.change()` and `.key_up()` events) would allow a second submission after the pending event is complete.
            js: optional frontend js method to run before running 'fn'. Input arguments for js method are values of 'inputs' and 'outputs', return should be a list of values for output components.
            concurrency_limit: if set, this is the maximum number of this event that can be running simultaneously. Can be set to None to mean no concurrency_limit (any number of this event can be running simultaneously). Set to "default" to use the default concurrency limit (defined by the `default_concurrency_limit` parameter in `Blocks.queue()`, which itself is 1 by default).
            concurrency_id: if set, this is the id of the concurrency group. Events with the same concurrency_id will be limited by the lowest set concurrency_limit.
            show_api: whether to show this event in the "view API" page of the Gradio app, or in the ".view_api()" method of the Gradio clients. Unlike setting api_name to False, setting show_api to False will still allow downstream apps as well as the Clients to use this event. If fn is None, show_api will automatically be set to False.
