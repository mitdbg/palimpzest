"Single-crystal ZrTe5 was grown with the flux method (21). Zr slugs ZrTe5 (99.9% pure, Alfa Aesar) and Te shot (99.9999% pure, Alfa Aesar) were loaded into a quartz ampule in a Zr:Te ratio of 1:100. The ampule was warmed to 900°C in 9 hours, kept at 900°C for 72 hours, and then cooled to 505°C in 48 hours. To promote large crystal growth, the ampule was repetitively cooled to 440°C and warmed to 505°C. Last, the ampule was cooled to 460°C and decanted in a centrifuge at this temperature.",ZrTe5

"High-quality single crystals of WTe2 were grown by means of Br2 vapour transport. Tungsten powder (99.9%) was ground together with purified tellurium (99.99%), pressed into a pellet and heated in an evacuated quartz tube at 700 uC for 2 days; this was homogenized and then reheated at 750 uC for a further 2 days. This final pellet was ground into a fine powder and a temperature gradient of 100 between uC 750 and 650 in a three-zone furnace was used for crystal growth, with a Br2 concentration of 3 mg ml-1 in a sealed quartz tube for 1 week. Optimal crystals were obtained under these conditions; crystals grown at higher temperatures showed substantially lower residual resistivity ratios r(300 K)/r(2 K) and degraded magnetoresistance.",WTe2

"SiC crystal growth was performed in a conven- tional PVT setup [6,7] modiﬁed by an additional pipe running through the lower isolation material and crucible wall into the growth cell (M-PVT setup, see Fig. 1). Using the additional pipe we were able to supply an external gas ﬂux to the crystal growth interface. The setup was inductively heated to temperatures above 20001C which were measured by a pyrometer on top of the crucible. The system pressure inside the growth cell was adjusted by a constant argon gas ﬂux in the outer setup chamber (typical for PVT setup) and by an inert or doping gas ﬂux through the additional inner gas pipe (new for M-PVT setup).",SiC
