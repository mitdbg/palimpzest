He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and practices as part of a new religious movement that he called Scientology .

Capote began his professional career writing short stories .", "file3": "He subsequently developed his ideas into a wide-ranging set of doctrines and practices as part of a new religious movement that he called Scientology . His writings became the guiding texts for the Church of Scientology and a number of affiliated organizations that address such diverse topics as business administration , literacy and drug rehabilitation . The Church 's dissemination of these materials led to Hubbard being listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the most translated and published author in the world . The Guinness World Record for the most audio books published for one author is also held by Hubbard .   Although many aspects of Hubbard 's life story are disputed , there is general agreement about its basic outline . Born in Tilden , Nebraska , he spent much of his childhood in Helena , Montana . He traveled in Asia and the South Pacific in the late 1920s after his father , an officer in the United States Navy , was posted to the U.S. naval base on Guam . He attended George Washington University in Washington , D.C. at the start of the 1930s , before dropping out and beginning his career as a prolific writer of pulp fiction stories ."}], "input_fields": ["claim"], "generated_fields": ["claim", "file1", "file2", "file3"], "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.1053309440612793, "failed_convert": false, "image_operation": null, "op_details": {"inputSchema": "FeverClaimsSchema(claim)", "outputSchema": "FeverIntermediateSchema(claim, file1, file2, file3)", "cardinality": "one-to-one", "udf": "functools.partial(<function get_relevant_content at 0x10b6525c0>, <ragatouille.RAGPretrainedModel.RAGPretrainedModel object at 0x136df0980>, 3)"}}, {"record_id": "19ac00ef89", "record_parent_id": "a4339abbad", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/fever-10/65007", "record_state": {"filename": "65007", "contents": "John Goodman did not star in The Flinstones.", "claim": "John Goodman did not star in The Flinstones.", "file1": "John Stephen Goodman -LRB- born June 20 , 1952 -RRB- is an American actor .
