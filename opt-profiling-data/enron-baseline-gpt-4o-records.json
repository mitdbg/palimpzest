Sept. lunch sounds good.  I sure hope we make good use of the bad news about Skilling's resignation and do some house cleaning - can we write down some problem assets and unwind raptor?  I've been horribly uncomfortable about some of our accounting in the past few years and with the number of 'redeployments' up, I'm concerned some disgruntled employee will tattle.  Can you influence some sanity?\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Buy, Rick \nSent: Tuesday, August 14, 2001 12:51 PM\nTo: Watkins, Sherron\nSubject: RE: portrac\n\n\nThanks for kind words.

It is a fantastic tool.  It's been needed for forever - I've been pulling together an asset list for Andy and Jeff Donahue - and I know first hand how difficult it is to get the detail that your group has input into portrac.  Donahue also thinks it's a great tool.  Lynn is going to demo it for Andy sometime soon.\n\nI'm working with Lynn and Dave Gorte's folks (Cindy Hudler) to create a livelink library of models, presentations, tax structures, etc. (all the files a corp dev person needs when we actively work an asset for sale).  We hope to have a link on the portrac web page similar to the DASH and COMET links.  It's very encouraging to see how far your group has come in organizing our investment data - Cindy's got a 30GB file of all models.  It sure makes my supposed 6 - 9 month job easier!\n\nSherron S.

I wasn't trying to be critical of anyone specifically, and I think Dick is doing an admirable job.  I will give him high marks at PRC.  However, one position that has lost a significant amount of value since we were free to sell it is Avici.  Do you think that at PRC, this \"loss\" of value, which does not show up in a P/L since it is hedged by Raptor, should be taken into account when we evaluate the person?  My point is only that each of these investments are \"positions\" that should be \"owned\" by someone, like a book.  Hickerson didn't get evaluated on Avici because it didn't show up in a P/L (even though he lost a lot of value).  What do we do with Garland?  Now it has lost a lot of value again.  If Dick could sell an asset for a 10% loss today, but doesn't, and we eventually lose 30% upon disposition, how do you evaluate the performance?\n\nAndy  \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLavorato, John  \nSent:\tTuesday, April 03, 2001 11:09 AM\nTo:\tFastow, Andrew S.\nCc:\tKitchen, Louise\nSubject:\t\n\nAndy\n\nWith respect to North America, Dick Lydecker is liquidating most of the raptor assets.

The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu. The mark=\net dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the session bet=\nween $2.10  $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as locals sold down =\nthe contract to the $2.07 support level and went home short. The AGA will r=\nelease this weeks storage report this afternoon, and while some traders are=\n predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf withdrawal, look for the numbe=\nr to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in the Midwest and Texas, the growi=\nng differential between cash and futures, and the perceived premium in the =\nearly March contract have kept the market from dropping further. Physical p=\nrices retained their premium over futures yesterday on short-term cold weat=\nher at some pipelines, maintaining about a $0.07  $0.10 premium over the NY=\nMEX. But cash traders expect the demand to ease quickly as temperatures mod=\nerate by t! his weekend. As usual, the market will look to the weekly stora=\nge report for short term direction, but it is the massive amount of volumes=\n still in storage compared to last year that has put a cap on longer term p=\nrice increases.

Skilling\n> resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its author was later\n> identified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for corporate\n> development at Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committee released\n> excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday:\n\n\n> Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't get\n> rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?\n> Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting\n> improprieties and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in its\n> accounting - most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor vehicle.\n> We do have valuation issues with our international assets and possibly\n> some of our EES MTM positions.\n> The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept that Skilling\nis\n> leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues can be fixed and\n> reported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002. How do we fix\n> the Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003, we will have\nto\n> pony up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed.\n> To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds flow\nof\n> $800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a vehicle\n> (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in later\nyears.\n> Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity issuance?\n> We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks via\nour\n> swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly - Avici\n> by 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power Company by\n> 80 percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the swaps won't\n> be there for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to offset these\n> losses. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the layman on the\nstreet\n> that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that\n> company with Enron stock in the future.\n> I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting\n> scandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on\nmy\n> r?sum?, the business world will consider the past successes as nothing\nbut\n> an elaborate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for \"personal\n> reasons\" but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down the road and\n> knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now than\n> resign in shame in two years.\n> Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I have\n> thought and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into one\n> big problem - we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and 2000, we\n> enjoyed wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold stock, we then\n> try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit like robbing the\n> bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later. Nice try, but\n> investors were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a share looking for $120\na\n> share and now they're at $38 or worse. We are under too much scrutiny and\n> there are probably one or two disgruntled \"redeployed\" employees who know\n> enough about the \"funny\" accounting to get us in trouble.\n> What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in the\n> all-employee meeting, but can you give some assurances that you and\nCausey\n> will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is going to\n> happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003?\n> Summary of Alleged Issues:\n>\n> RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at risk;\n> however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM.\n> If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is no\n> commitment to contribute more equity.\n> The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form of\n> Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.\n> Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptor\n> entities locking in our values for various equity investments we hold.\n> As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the\n> equity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying\n> securities.\n> This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying\n> capitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing\n> for reserves against our MTM positions.\n> To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we \"enhanced\"\n> the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing more ENE shares.\n> My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must \"enhance\"\n> the vehicles by $250 million.\n> I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and a\nlot\n> of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting treatment.\n> None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed\n> in the bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's problems of\nWaste\n> Management (news/quote\n>\n</redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custo\n> m/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=WMI>) - where AA paid $130 million\n> plus in litigation re questionable accounting practices.)\n> The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain the\n> \"accounting treatment\" to a man in the street, would you influence his\n> investing decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on a thorough\n> understanding of the facts? If so, you best present it correctly and/or\n> change the accounting.\n> My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the\n> transactions. If adequately explained, the investor would know that the\n> \"entities\" described in our related party footnote are thinly\ncapitalized,\n> the equity holders have no skin in the game, and all the value in the\n> entities comes from the underlying value of the derivatives\n(unfortunately\n> in this case, a big loss) AND Enron stock and N/P. Looking at the stock\nwe\n> swapped, I also don't believe any other company would have entered into\n> the equity derivative transactions with us at the same prices or without\n> substantial premiums from Enron. In other words, the $500 million in\n> revenue in 2000 would have been much lower. How much lower?\n> Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well, then no\n> one would be the wiser. If Enron stock did well, the stock issuance to\n> these entities would decline and the transactions would be less\n> noticeable. All has gone against us. The stocks, most notably Hanover,\nthe\n> New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser degrees.\n> I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a\n> clear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the\n> transactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities\nlaw\n> and accounting. I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for himself\n> what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the estimated\n> damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one of two\n> courses of action:\n> 1. The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated damage\ntoo\n> great; therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly reverse, unwind,\n> write down these positions/transactions.\n> 2. The probability of discovery is too great, the estimated damages to\nthe\n> company too great; therefore, we must quantify, develop damage\ncontainment\n> plans and disclose.\n> I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly\nincreased\n> with Skilling's shocking departure. Too many people are looking for a\n> smoking gun.\n> Summary of Raptor Oddities:\n> 1. The accounting treatment looks questionable.\n> a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a\nrelated\n> party.\n> b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk except\n> Enron.\n> c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a\n> contribution of its own shares.\n> One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in its\n> equity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I can't\n> find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who will\nlose\n> this money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party entity?\n> If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact\npattern\n> that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors.\n> 2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms length.\n> a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party at\n> what now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici have\n> fallen away significantly since. The related party was unable to lay off\n> this risk. This fact pattern is once again very negative for Enron.\n> b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into\nthese\n> transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was the\n> compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such\n> transactions?\n> 3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees question\n> our accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This alone is cause\n> for concern.\n> a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM. He\n> complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought\n> should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later,\n> Skilling offered him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Markets and\nnever\n> addressed the five steps with him.\n> b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen\n> about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM.\n> c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal investments\n> group say, \"I know it would be devastating to all of us, but I wish we\n> would get caught. We're such a crooked company.\" The principal\ninvestments\n> group hedged a large number of their investments with Raptor. These\npeople\n> know and see a lot. Many similar comments are made when you ask about\n> these deals. Employees quote our C.F.O. as saying that he has a handshake\n> deal with Skilling that LJM will never lose money.\n> 4. Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the money\n> trail between Enron and LJM/Raptor and its principals? Can he look at\nLJM?\n> At Raptor? If the C.F.O. says no, isn't that a problem?\n> Condor and Raptor Work:\n", "sender": "gregory.schockling@enron.com", "subject": "FW: E memo"}, {"filename": "townsend-j-inbox-7-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <17258760.1075841970884.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 5 Feb 2002 21:11:17 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: enerfaxtext@enerfax.com\nTo: judy.townsend@enron.com\nSubject: Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower in Quiet Trading\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: \"Enerfax\" <Enerfaxtext@enerfax.com>@ENRON\nX-To: Townsend, Judy </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JTOWNSE>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Townsend, Judy\\Inbox\nX-Origin: TOWNSEND-J\nX-FileName: judy townsend 6-26-02.PST\n\njudy.townsend@enron.com, To unsubscribe send a blank mailto:leave-enerfaxtext-14816594U@relay.netatlantic.com\n\n\nEnerfax Daily\nNORTH AMERICA'S FREE POWER AND GAS INFORMATION SOURCE\n              Wednesday, February 6 2002 No. 928\nVisit: http://www.enerfax.com to view our web version or for Oil Prices &\nNews http://www.enerfaxgold.com\n\nPHYSICAL NATURAL GAS PRICES\nGulf/Eastern Region\n| Agua Dulce              | 2.08  |\n| ANR SE                  | 2.14  |\n| Carthage TG             | 2.13  |\n| Chicago Citygate        | 2.20  |\n| Columbia Gulf Onshore   | 2.18  |\n| Dominion South Point    | 2.46  |\n| Henry Hub               | 2.20  |\n| Houston Ship Channel    | 2.19  |\n| Katy Hub                | 2.12  |\n| NGPL LA Pool            | 2.14  |\n| NGPL - Midcontinent     | 2.09  |\n| NGPL STX                | 2.09  |\n| NGPL TX/OK              | 2.12  |\n| NNG Demarc.             | 2.15  |\n| Niagara                 | 2.46  |\n| Sonat Tier 1            | 2.16  |\n| TCO IPP Pool            | 2.29  |\n| Tetco ELa               | 2.18  |\n| Tetco M-3               | 2.69  |\n| Tetco STX               | 2.11  |\n| TGP Zone 0              | 2.10  |\n| TGP Zone 1 (500 Leg)    | 2.16  |\n| TGT Zone SL             | 2.18  |\n| New York Citygate       | 3.00  |\n| Transco Station 65      | 2.22  |\n| Transco Zone 6 (NY)     | 3.00  |\n| Trunk ELa               | 2.14  |\n| Western Region\n| California Border       | 2.16  |\n| El Paso Keystone        | 2.04  |\n| El Paso San Juan-Blanco | 2.05  |\n| Waha Hub                | 2.08  |\n| Canadian/Rockies Region\n| Nova/Aeco (C$/gig)      | 2.83  |\n| Dawn Hub/Union          | 2.29  |\n| Northwest Stanfield     | 1.99  |\n| Wyoming Pool            | 1.91  |\n| Opal                    | 1.91  |\n| PGT-Malin               | 2.08  |\n| Sumas                   | 1.95  |\n         Flow Date 2/6\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNATURAL GAS FUTURES\nHenry Hub\n12 Month Strip  2.4864  -0.0152\n18 Month Strip  2.5950  -0.0073\n| Month | High  |  Low  | Close | Change |\n|  MAR  | 2.140 | 2.070 | 2.074 | -0.043 |\n|  APR  | 2.200 | 2.150 | 2.152 | -0.032 |\n|  MAY  | 2.260 | 2.220 | 2.227 | -0.025 |\n|  JUN  | 2.325 | 2.290 | 2.297 | -0.020 |\n|  JUL  | 2.385 | 2.355 | 2.362 | -0.015 |\n|  AUG  | 2.435 | 2.415 | 2.419 | -0.013 |\n|  SEP  | 2.440 | 2.422 | 2.422 | -0.010 |\n|  OCT  | 2.460 | 2.440 | 2.450 | -0.009 |\n|  NOV  | 2.690 | 2.670 | 2.670 | -0.009 |\n|  DEC  | 2.895 | 2.870 | 2.873 | -0.006 |\n|  JAN  | 2.990 | 2.965 | 2.968 | -0.001 |\n|  FEB  | 2.940 | 2.920 | 2.923 | +0.001 |\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n-\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nAcross the Energy Enterprise\n\ne-Acumen, Inc., is uniquely positioned to help you manage risk and\nincrease value.

The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu.\nThe market dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the\nsession between $2.10 - $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as\nlocals sold down the contract to the $2.07 support level and went home\nshort. The AGA will release this week's storage report this afternoon, and\nwhile some traders are predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf\nwithdrawal, look for the number to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in\nthe Midwest and Texas, the growing differential between cash and futures,\nand the perceived premium in the early March contract have kept the market\nfrom dropping further. Physical prices retained their premium over futures\nyesterday on short-term cold weather at some pipelines, maintaining about\na $0.07 - $0.10 premium over the NYMEX. But cash traders expect the demand\nto ease quickly as temperatures moderate by this weekend. As usual, the\nmarket will look to the weekly storage report for short term direction,\nbut it is the massive amount of volumes still in storage compared to last\nyear that has put a cap on longer term price increases. Natural gas for\nnext day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to plus or\nminus a few cents yesterday.

In\ntestimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that\nEnron had a $500 million loss in March. Rather than report it to\nshareholders, Enron gave a partnership called Raptor another $800 million\nin Enron shares. He said that there is no doubt that almost everyone, from\nthe board of directors on down, knew that the company was attempting to\noffset investment losses with stock. The partnerships allowed Enron to\nmisrepresent earnings for a period spanning the 3rd quarter of 2000\nthrough the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers told that committee\nthat over 70% of Enron's earnings for that period were false. He said that\nthere were red flags that should have alerted former chairman Ken Lay to\nwhat was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely understood that Enron\nwas using its own stock to offset the losses in the partnerships.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFAST.

This was a good price (average price LTM of 37p), but was below the quarter end price.  Therefore, there is a Q3 loss of $6.4 million.  Andrew Marsden is managing this in London.\nCompleted all requirements to sell COPEL shares (a $100+ million investment in the Brazilian utility).  Began selling shares on 7/17.  Current price is approximately $14 million below carrying value of approximately $120 million.  Likely to take a couple of months to exit entire position.  Investment is carried as \"Strategic\", and any losses upon the sale will fall \"below the line\" in the sale of non-merchant asset line.  Steven Sheldon is managing this.\nCompleted negotiations on the sale of Utiliquest for $62.5 million.  Should sign on Thursday.  Enron had invested $11.6 million in cash (net of JEDI II) and will receive $14.3 million.  The sale will net a cash gain to Enron, but below our carrying value of $16.3 million, yielding a $2 million accounting loss.  Kevin Kuykendall is managing this.\nFinalized processes to begin selling Hanover Compressor shares.  We own 4.6 million shares, which are trading at $30.00/share for a total value of $138 million.  Hanover has been hedged through Raptor.  However, the structure that was used to hedge is a costless collar that leaves Enron exposed below $34.875/share.  Therefore, at current trading levels we are facing a $23 million loss.  We are working with CSFB, which has proposed to execute a block trade sale.  However, the stock continues to decline each day, and CSFB will not make an offer until the price stabilizes.  If we have to sell at a block discount, or if the price continues to fall we could be facing a $35 million to $40 million loss.  Needless to say, we are very focused on this investment.\nLosses from Venture Capital positions appear to be approximately $10 million for Q3, which is primarily the result of write-offs in the HEOF portfolio.\nNet quarterly expectations: Cash proceeds received from sales - ~$250 million, losses from sales below carrying value ~$60 million ($46 million \"above the line\" and $14 million \"below the line\").  \n\nIntegration\nAll personnel decisions made.\nLegal (Gil Melman), RAC (Randy Petersen), accounting (Hope Vargas), HR (Sheila Walton) and Tax (Jim Sandt) support personnel determined.\nEveryone moving to same location (EB36) today.\nPreparation of 2nd half 2001 budget (revenue and expense) still in process.  To be completed by 7/31.\nBack office systems and filing systems in process of integration.  To be completed by 7/31.\n\nProcess Standardization\nMid stream of development of deal filtering, deal evaluation and due diligence, modeling, approval, portfolio management, and exit (all to be completed by 8/15).\nNeed to develop permanent approval process, including approval limits.\n\nStrategy Development\nStrategy is currently being vetted through a collaborative process including all senior members of the group and RAC.\nFinal drafting session for 5-7 page strategy/charter paper and 10 page powerpoint presentation scheduled for July 27.\nPresentation of strategy to Greg and Ken is scheduled for July 30, to Jeff Skilling on August 15.\n\nOther Issues\nGiven Andy Fastow's involvement with Corp Dev, and our groups need for capital, I would like to add Andy to the Investment Committee.  Please provide feedback.\n\nThanks,\nKG\n\n", "sender": "kevin.garland@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Principal Investments Update"}, {"filename": "zipper-a-espeed-28.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <19460654.1075851675082.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 29 Nov 2000 11:34:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: travis.mccullough@enron.com\nTo: andy.zipper@enron.com\nSubject: Redraft of the Exclusivity Agreement\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Travis McCullough\nX-To: Andy Zipper\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Andrew_Zipper_Nov2001\\Notes Folders\\Espeed\nX-Origin: ZIPPER-A\nX-FileName: azipper.nsf\n\nHeard the Skilling meeting was postponed.

Specifically\nI suggested that the requirement that the Enron Platform be \"operated\" by an\nEnron Party be deleted, and leaving only the limitation of ownership.\n\n I have given Anthony comments on the series designation.
