Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, after Jeffrey K.\nSkilling resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its author\nwas later identified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for\ncorporate development at Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committee\nreleased excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday:\n\n   Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't\nget rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?\n   Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting\nimproprieties and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in\nits accounting -- most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor\nvehicle. We do have valuation issues with our international assets and\npossibly some of our EES MTM positions.\n\n   The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept that\nSkilling is leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues can\nbe fixed and reported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002.\nHow do we fix the Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003,\nwe will have to pony up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed.\n\n   To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds\nflow of $800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a\nvehicle (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in\nlater years. Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity\nissuance?\n\n   We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks\nvia our swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly\n-- Avici by 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power\nCompany by 80 percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the\nswaps won't be there for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to\noffset these losses. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the\nlayman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company and\nwill compensate that company with Enron stock in the future.\n\n   I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting\nscandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on\nmy resume, the business world will consider the past successes as\nnothing but an elaborate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for\n''personal reasons'' but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down\nthe road and knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship\nnow than resign in shame in two years.\n\n   Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I\nhave thought and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into\none big problem -- we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and\n2000, we enjoyed wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold\nstock, we then try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit\nlike robbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years\nlater. Nice try, but investors were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a\nshare looking for $120 a share and now they're at $38 or worse. We are\nunder too much scrutiny and there are probably one or two disgruntled\n''redeployed'' employees who know enough about the ''funny'' accounting\nto get us in trouble.\n\n   What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in the\nall-employee meeting, but can you give some assurances that you and\nCausey will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is\ngoing to happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003?\n\n   Summary of Alleged Issues:\n\n   RAPTOR  Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at\nrisk; however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid\nto LJM. If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is\nno commitment to contribute more equity.\n\n   The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some\nform of Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.\n\n   Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the\nRaptor entities locking in our values for various equity investments we\nhold.\n\n   As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the\nequity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying\nsecurities.\n\n   This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying\ncapitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing\nfor reserves against our MTM positions.\n\n   To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we\n''enhanced'' the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing\nmore ENE shares.\n\n   My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must\n''enhance'' the vehicles by $250 million.\n\n   I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and\na lot of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting\ntreatment. None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are\never disclosed in the bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's\nproblems of Waste Management -- where AA paid $130 million plus in\nlitigation re questionable accounting practices.)\n\n   The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain\nthe ''accounting treatment'' to a man in the street, would you influence\nhis investing decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on a\nthorough understanding of the facts? If so, you best present it\ncorrectly and/or change the accounting.\n\n   My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the\ntransactions. If adequately explained, the investor would know that the\n''entities'' described in our related party footnote are thinly\ncapitalized, the equity holders have no skin in the game, and all the\nvalue in the entities comes from the underlying value of the derivatives\n(unfortunately in this case, a big loss) AND Enron stock and N/P.\nLooking at the stock we swapped, I also don't believe any other company\nwould have entered into the equity derivative transactions with us at\nthe same prices or without substantial premiums from Enron. In other\nwords, the $500 million in revenue in 2000 would have been much lower.\nHow much lower?\n\n   Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well, then\nno one would be the wiser. If Enron stock did well, the stock issuance\nto these entities would decline and the transactions would be less\nnoticeable. All has gone against us. The stocks, most notably Hanover,\nthe New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser\ndegrees.\n\n   I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a\nclear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the\ntransactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities\nlaw and accounting. I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for\nhimself what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the\nestimated damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one\nof two courses of action:\n\n   1. The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated\ndamage too great; therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly\nreverse, unwind, write down these positions/transactions.\n\n   2. The probability of discovery is too great, the estimated damages\nto the company too great; therefore, we must quantify, develop damage\ncontainment plans and disclose.\n\n   I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly\nincreased with Skilling's shocking departure. Too many people are\nlooking for a smoking gun.\n\n   Summary of Raptor Oddities:\n\n   1. The accounting treatment looks questionable.\n\n   a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a\nrelated party.\n\n   b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk\nexcept Enron.\n\n   c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a\ncontribution of its own shares.\n\n   One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in\nits equity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I\ncan't find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who\nwill lose this money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party\nentity?\n\n   If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact\npattern that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors.\n\n   2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms\nlength.\n\n   a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party\nat what now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici\nhave fallen away significantly since. The related party was unable to\nlay off this risk. This fact pattern is once again very negative for\nEnron.\n\n   b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into\nthese transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was\nthe compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such\ntransactions?\n\n   3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees\nquestion our accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This\nalone is cause for concern.\n\n   a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM.\nHe complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he\nthought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days\nlater, Skilling offered him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Markets\nand never addressed the five steps with him.\n\n   b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would\nlisten about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM.\n\n   c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal\ninvestments group say, ''I know it would be devastating to all of us,\nbut I wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company.'' The\nprincipal investments group hedged a large number of their investments\nwith Raptor. These people know and see a lot. Many similar comments are\nmade when you ask about these deals. Employees quote our C.F.O. as\nsaying that he has a handshake deal with Skilling that LJM will never\nlose money.\n\n   4. Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the\nmoney trail between Enron and LJM/Raptor and its principals? Can he look\nat LJM? At Raptor? If the C.F.O. says no, isn't that a problem?\n\n   Condor and Raptor Work:\n\n   1. Postpone decision on filling office of the chair, if the current\ndecision includes C.F.O. and/or C.A.O.\n\n   2. Involve Jim Derrick and Rex Rogers to hire a law firm to\ninvestigate the Condor and Raptor transactions to give Enron\nattorney-client privilege on the work product. (Can't use V & E due to\nconflict -- they provided some true sale opinions on some of the deals).\n\n   3.

It had  thrown out the energy-industry playbook, remaking itself from a staid gas  pipeline company to a high-tech trading firm that created exotic securities for  betting on everything from gas prices to the number of hot days in  summer.\nShare prices soared from $30 to $90 between 1998 and 2000, as  sales increased from $31 billion to more than $100 billion. Enron executives  gained reputations as the energy industry's visionaries.\nThis fall it all  came apart. Share prices have fallen by 90% this year, including a plunge from  just below $40 to less than $10 this fall. In October, Enron reported a  third-quarter loss of $618 million. The company's massive debt was downgraded to  near junk-bond status, and the CEO and CFO were expelled. Shareholders sued and  the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an  investigation.\nFinally, the humiliated company, which employs more than  20,000, agreed Nov. 9 to be taken over by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc.  for about $9 billion in stock and $13 billion in assumed debt. It is not certain  the merger will take place since it is subject to regulatory approval and could  be blocked on antitrust grounds. And some news accounts suggest that major  Dynegy shareholders could derail the merger over concerns about inheriting  liabilities from current or future lawsuits by Enron shareholders.\nThe  Enron story is not simply a case of a lone company that played with fire and got  burned. Enron was able to take enormous risks while keeping shareholders in the  dark because it could exploit accounting loopholes for subsidiaries that are  available to most publicly traded companies. Companies like Enron can legally  conceal massive debts because rules require a full accounting of a subsidiary's  balance sheet only when the parent company owns more than half of it.\n\"If  I'm a shareholder of Enron and I want full and fair disclosure, I would want  information about the entities Enron controls,\" says Wharton accounting  professor Robert E. Verrecchia. Yet Enron shareholders have never received such  a report.\nEnron's fate is crucial to the energy industry and other  markets it serves, points out Paul R. Kleindorfer, a professor of public policy  and an expert on deregulation at Wharton. Producers and users of gas, oil,  electricity and other forms of energy rely on Enron's system for trading  futures, forwards, options, swaps and other contracts to get the best prices and  control costs far into the future. Without such a system, deregulation simply  cannot work.\n\"If Enron's trading platform were to go down it would not be  a minor loss,\" Kleindorfer says. \"It would be a huge loss for the industry?.In  the early 1990s the company single-handedly produced the backbone infrastructure  that has led to a whole industry of broker intermediation.\"\nTo some  extent, Enron appears to have been a victim of sagging securities prices and  volatile energy costs in 2000 and 2001, and it has lost hundreds of millions by  laying fiber-optic cable for which there is no demand. But although those  factors may have determined the timing of the company's troubles, they were not  the chief cause. Enron appears to have lost enormous amounts of shareholder  money by gambling at its own roulette wheels.\n\"In hindsight, we made some  very bad investments in non-core businesses that performed worse than we ever  could have conceived,\" Chairman Kenneth Lay told analysts last week.\nHow  did Enron get into this mess?\nBecoming a Market Maker\nWhen  it was created in 1985 by the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth,  parent company of Northern Natural Gas, Enron's chief business was the operation  of thousands of miles of natural gas pipeline. Lay became chairman in Feb. 1986.  Then early in the 1990s, the federal government took key steps to deregulate the  energy industry.\nPreviously, large regulated utilities were vertically  integrated, giving them control from wellhead to consumer, Kleindorfer says.  Deregulation effectively broke apart the production, long-range transmission and  local distribution functions, leaving each to a different set of players. A  factory owner, for example, can now buy gas or electricity from number of  producers.\nTo function, a free market such as this needs brokers, or  intermediaries, to create, buy and sell contracts for production and delivery,  and it requires a market maker to facilitate trading, just as the big Wall  Street firms and exchanges facilitate trading in stocks. Enron created that  marketplace. \"This intermediation activity, or brokerage activity, just  revolutionized the marketplace,\" Kleindorfer says.\nSince utilities and  other energy users must line up dependable supplies for many months in the  future, they rely on various forms of contracts specifying quantities, prices  and delivery dates. But before the commodity is delivered, prevailing prices may  go up or down, and a supplier may find it has promised to sell at a price that's  now too low, while a purchaser may find that it could have bought for less than  it had agreed to pay.\nSuppliers and purchasers therefore use a variety of  derivative contracts to benefit from prices that move in their favor and hedge  in case prices move against them. A company that has contracted to buy a  shipload of liquefied natural gas at a specific price in three months, could,  for a much smaller sum, buy an options contract giving it the right, but not the  obligation, to buy a shipload at a lower price. And it could buy an option  giving it the right to sell at a higher price. Thus it is protected regardless  of whether prices move up or down.\nThis was the business Enron invented.  By permitting competition and price discovery far into the future, it brought to  the marketplace the most efficient pricing and allowed energy users to predict  and stabilize costs far into the future, Kleindorfer says. \"Having that  information historically, as well as projected into the future, could  revolutionize how you plan your business,\" he said. \nAt the heart of  Enron's business strategy was the belief that it could be a big energy player  without owning all the power plants, ships, pipelines and other facilities  involved. Instead, it could use contracts to control the facilities in which  other companies had invested, says Ehud Ronn, director of the Center for Energy  Finance Education and Research at the Red McCombs School of Business at the  University of Texas at Austin. The Center trains masters candidates in the use  of energy securities. (Enron is one of the center's eight corporate  sponsors.)\nEnron, he says, evolved into something akin to a Wall Street  firm. \"Enron thought of itself in very similar terms as an investment banker  that wanted to tie up as little capital as possible.\"\nBy 2001, Enron had  evolved into a market maker for some 1,800 different products, many of them  energy- or Internet-related contracts or derivatives the company had created  itself. They included products allowing customers to buy, sell, hedge or  speculate in markets ranging from traditional commodities like coal, oil, gas  and electricity to cutting edge markets for Internet bandwidth, pollution  emissions, semiconductors, wind energy and many others. Prices for many of these  products were available on the company's free website, giving the energy markets  unprecedented price transparency.\nBetting on the Weather\nTo  see how these products could be used, consider one of Enron's \"weather risk  management\" products meant for utilities, energy distributors, agricultural  companies and financial institutions. A gas utility, for example, might use a  \"floor\" to protect its revenue in the event of a mild winter. In exchange for a  premium similar to that paid on an insurance policy, Enron will compensate the  utility for every day between November and March on which the temperature rises  above a set level. The payments would make up for reduced gas sales.\nIn  another form of contract called a swap, or collar, Enron will pay the gas  company a given amount if the number of warm days exceeds a set level. But if  the number of cold days exceeds a threshold, the gas company will make a  payment to Enron. The utility would not have to pay a premium as it would with  the floor, and if it had to pay Enron, the money would come from the extra  revenue received by selling more gas in a colder-than normal winter.\nTo a  layman this might look like betting. \"We never use that word,\" says Ronn. \"The  worst we say is to 'have a view.'\"\nIn practice, other parties are often  involved in such transactions, taking over the contractual obligation created by  Enron. So, in addition to placing its own bets, Enron serves as a middleman, the  way a stockbroker stands in the middle of a securities trade.\nLike many  middlemen, Enron has to be in a position to make good on any transaction should  either party default. Otherwise, it would be hard to make a market in these  products. In addition, says Ronn, Enron often has to pay out money before  receiving payment from another party. Finally, Enron needed large amounts of  capital to trade products in its own account, just as a Wall Street firm invests  in stocks on its own in addition to executing customers' trades. To accomplish  all this, Enron needed vast amounts of capital. \"You do need to have liquidity  in huge numbers,\" Ronn says.\nThis created a dilemma. A public company can  raise capital by selling additional shares, but current shareholders don't like  that because the new shares dilute the value of their holdings. The alternative  is to borrow, but large debts hurt a company's credit rating, forcing it to pay  higher interest rates on its loans.\nAndrew S. Fastow, who became the  company's senior vice president of finance in 1990, found innovative ways to  issue new shares without dilution and to raise capital by selling old-fashioned  assets like power plants and pipelines.\n\"He has invented a groundbreaking  strategy,\" Ted. A. Izatt, senior vice president at Lehman Brother's Inc., told  CFO Magazine in the fall of 1999. Or, as Enron president and CEO Jeffrey  K. Skilling told the magazine: \"We needed someone to rethink the entire  financing structure at Enron from soup to nuts. We didn't want someone stuck in  the past, since the industry of yesterday is no longer. Andy has the  intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways. He deserves every  accolade tossed his way.\"\nFastow, named chief financial officer in March  1998, told the magazine: \"We transformed finance into a merchant  organization?.Essentially, we would buy and sell risk positions.\" A key to the  strategy: Move many of Enron's transactions \"off the balance sheet.\" In part,  this involved exploiting a loophole in the securities and accounting  regulations. As noted earlier, debts accumulated by subsidiaries, partnerships  or other \"entities\" can be kept off the parent company's books so long as the  parent does not own more than 50% of the entity incurring the debt.\nBy  using so-called unconsolidated subsidiaries, \"you do not make transparent either  the nature of the investment or the relationship between the parent and the  subsidiary,\" said Verrecchia. Heavy hitters such as Wall Street analysts and  major shareholders may have the clout to get a company to provide additional  information on subsidiaries. \"But if you're just an investor picking up Enron's  annual report, you are stuck,\" Verrecchia added.\nA Pattern of Sketchy  Details \nIt has long been clear from company statements and SEC  filings that Enron's off-balance-sheet transactions were enormous, but details  were sketchy because Enron did not have to report them, and chose not to. By  this fall, however, it became obvious these transactions involved huge risks  when Enron acknowledged it had improperly kept some activity off its books.  Putting those debts and losses into Enron's financial statements last month  meant reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. Corrected statements reduced  net income by $96 million for 1997, $113 million for 1998, $250 million for 1999  and $132 million for 2000.\nAt issue were so-called \"special purpose  entities,\" or SPEs, set up for a variety of transactions for Enron's benefit.  Enron conceded some of these entities did not meet the accounting standards to  be kept off of Enron's books. In one case, for instance, the entity had  \"inadequate capitalization\" for such treatment.\nIn 2000, Enron had  created four entities known as Raptor I, II, III and IV to \"hedge market risk in  certain of its investments,\" according to an Enron filing with the SEC. Enron  acquired notes receivable from the Raptors in exchange for an obligation to  issue Enron shares to the entities. But Enron had improperly included the value  of the notes receivable on its books without accounting for the cost of the  shares it would have to issue. In correcting this violation of accounting rules,  Enron said it had overstated its shareholders equity by $1 billion in March and  June 2001.\nEnron was particularly embarrassed in acknowledging that two  special purpose entities, limited partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM Co-Investment,  had Fastow as the managing partner. Fastow, who according to Enron made in  excess of $30 million in this role, was forced out of the company in October. An  internal committee and the SEC are investigating the use of the  partnerships.\nObviously, Fastow's role was a problem. If the partnerships  were truly independent entities, he was in a conflict of interest. If he was  running them on Enron's behalf, they were not independent.\nDespite the  write-downs and disclosures this fall, many analysts complain they still do not  have a full picture of Enron's activities. Enron, for instance, has not fully  described other partnerships it believes it can properly keep off the balance  sheet. Nor is it clear to what extent Enron's losses are due to bad bets it had  made through highly-leveraged derivatives. While a stock market investor can  simply hang on to shares to wait out a downturn, options and other derivatives  typically have expiration dates. If the bet has not turned out as hoped, the  entire investment can be lost.\n\"New disclosure was modest and management  did not resolve concerns,\" Goldman Sachs analysts David Maccarrone and David  Fleischer wrote in an Oct. 24 report to clients. Though Enron had long faced  such criticisms, investors had tended to give the company the benefit of the  doubt \"because of its strong growth in earnings and acknowledged industry  leading capabilities?,\" the two analysts said.\nIn other words, when stock  was soaring, investors didn't require details on how it was done. Now they are  crying foul, and a number of shareholder suits have been filed. Essentially,  they claim the company inflated its stock price by filing false financial  statements. Investors who bought shares at those high prices have suffered huge  losses.\nFor years, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets  accounting rules, has had a draft proposal for improving disclosure of  subsidiaries' activities and numbers. Essentially, it would move toward a more  qualitative evaluation of whether the parent controlled the subsidiary even if  it owned less than 50% of the stock. Control could be exerted by holding board  seats or through contracts that effectively make the subsidiary a unit of the  parent.\n\"What the FASB has promulgated seems to me to be sensible,\"  Verrecchia said, noting that the whole purpose of accounting is to give an  accurate view of a company's inner workings and true earnings. To conceal  obligations, risk and debt, as Enron and others do, undermines that goal, he  said.\nBut, facing heavy opposition from accountants and corporations, the  FASB has not acted on the draft proposal, citing insufficient support on its  board. So for the time being, off-balance-sheet transactions will continue to be  a common practice among American corporations."}, "op_id": "24a4e4976d", "logical_op_id": "fde16923e7", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 0.00010704994201660156, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null, "image_operation": null, "op_details": {"outputSchema": "TextFile(contents, filename)", "dataset_id": "enron-eval"}}, {"record_id": "a1483af24b", "record_parent_id": null, "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/kitchen-l-americas-sec-media-42-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "kitchen-l-americas-sec-media-42-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <430201.1075840931879.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 9 Nov 2001 05:11:29 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: m..schmidt@enron.com\nSubject: Enron Mentions\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Schmidt, Ann M. </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=ASCHMID>\nX-To: \nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Kitchen, Louise\\'Americas\\SEC media\nX-Origin: KITCHEN-L\nX-FileName: louise kitchen 2-7-02.pst\n\nEnron Slashes Profits Since 1997 by 20% --- Partnership Dealings Cited As Dynegy Talks Go On; Debt Ratings an Issue\nThe Wall Street Journal, 11/09/01\nDoes Enron Trust Its New Numbers?

Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith in Los Angeles and Robin Sidel and Jonathan Weil in New York\n\n11/09/2001\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA3\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nEnron Corp. reduced its previously reported net income dating back to 1997 by $586 million, or 20%, mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings with partnerships run by some company officers. \nThe disclosure, contained in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, came even as the Houston energy-trading company continued its merger talks with rival Dynegy Inc. Dynegy, an independent power producer and utility owner, is looking at acquiring Enron for roughly $7 billion to $8 billion, people familiar with the talks say. However, those talks could also be influenced by whether Enron is further downgraded by major credit-ratings agencies.\nThe total price being discussed would equate to about $10 an Enron share, barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Enron shares were down 7.1%, or 64 cents, to $8.41, a tenth of their 52-week high of $84.875. \nOn the Big Board, Dynegy traded at $36.50, up $3.50. Shares of several energy-trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the California state government pay an estimated $1.6 billion for past power purchases. \nIn yesterday's SEC filing, Enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets, debt and shareholder equity back to 1997. For instance, for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, Enron lopped about $2.2 billion, or 19%, off shareholder equity, reducing it to a total of $9.5 billion. Previously, the company had disclosed a reduction of only $1.2 billion. \nThe filing also said that Enron discharged Ben Glisan, the company treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of Enron's North America unit, in connection with investments they made in one of the officer-run limited partnerships. Until yesterday, Enron had insisted that Mr. Glisan wasn't associated with the officer-run partnerships. The company wouldn't explain why the the two had been discharged, and Mr. Glisan and Ms. Mordaunt couldn't be reached to comment. \nThe SEC filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation's biggest energy-trading company during the past month. During that time, Enron has reported a big third-quarter loss, the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships, and an SEC investigation. \nThe SEC filing raises further questions about Enron's accounting procedures and disclosure policies. Concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts, including those at major credit-rating agencies. The agencies downgraded Enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for further downgrades. \nRalph Pellecchia, credit analyst for Fitch, said he couldn't predict what effect the SEC filing would have on Enron's credit rating, but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures. \"It's bad,\" he said. \nThe Enron SEC filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, which reviewed the company's annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals. Because of all the accounting adjustments \"the audit reports covering the year-end financial statements for 1997-2000 should not be relied upon,\" yesterday's SEC filing said. \nAn Andersen spokesman called Enron's restatement announcement \"an unfortunate situation\" but said the accounting firm is \"cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters.\" He said he couldn't comment further because of client-confidentiality concerns. \nAmong the accounting turnabouts, Enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to Michael \nKopper, a former managing director of the company's North America unit. The two partnerships were known as Joint Energy Development Investments LP, or JEDI, and Chewco Investments LP. \nAs reported, Mr. Kopper managed the general partner of Chewco, which was formed in 1997. JEDI had been formed in 1993 by Enron in partnership with the huge California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers. \nIn 1997 Enron, which operated JEDI, bought out Calpers' interest for $383 million and immediately sold it to Chewco, according to the SEC filing. Almost all the money for Chewco's purchase came in loans from JEDI and an unnamed financial institution, whose loan was guaranteed by Enron. \nBy having a supposed outside party in the form of Chewco as a partner, Enron treated JEDI as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet. Enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both JEDI and Chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997. Taking that step retroactively resulted in a $396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000, the SEC filing said. \nMr. Kopper, who left Enron in July to run the partnerships, didn't return a phone call seeking comment. In the past, he has declined to be interviewed. \nEnron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called LJM Cayman LP. That consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $103 million. \nLJM and a similar but much larger partnership, called LJM2 Co-Investment LP, were formed in 1999 by Enron's then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was replaced last month. The two partnerships were run by Mr. Fastow and Mr. Kopper, according to the Enron SEC filing and private partnership documents. Enron's SEC filing said the company believes that Mr. Fastow sold his interests in the LJM partnerships in July to Mr. Kopper. Mr. Fastow has declined to be interviewed. \nSeveral analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger LJM2 partnership. Some also pointed to a sentence in the SEC filing that said \"it is possible\" that continuing Enron reviews will \"identify additional or different information concerning these matters.\" \nAs such, \"there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the closet,\" said Brian Youngberg, energy analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. \nThe Enron SEC filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the LJM partnerships. Since 1999, those transactions produced $577.8 million in pretax earnings, despite a $711 million pretax charge in this year's third quarter due to the termination of deals with several LJM2-related entities. The filing also estimated that Mr. Fastow received more than $30 million from the LJM partnerships. \n--- Mea Culpa\n\nIn the midst of talks to be acquired by Dynegy, Enron details\naccounting and other actions.\n\n-- Will restate its financial results from 1997 through the third\nquarter of 2001, reducing previously reported income by $586 million\nand boosting previously reported debt to $628 million at the end of\n2000\n\n-- Concedes three entities run by company officials should have been\nincluded in its consolidated financial statements, based on generally\naccepted accounting principles\n\n-- Fires Ben Glisan, managing director and treasurer, and Kristina\nMordaunt, managing director and general counsel of an Enron division\n\n-- Establishes a special committee to review all transactions\n\nSource: the company\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It Doesn't Act Like It\nBy FLOYD NORRIS\n\n11/09/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 1, Column 2\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\n\nYOU'D be better informed if, instead of listening to what we say, you watch what we do.'' \nThat excellent advice was not issued by Enron management, although it should have been. Instead it came more than 30 years ago from John N. Mitchell, President Richard M. Nixon's attorney general.\nEnron's restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company's many strange transactions with related parties. It is now consolidating the results of some of its off-balance-sheet creations, though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery. \nBut the restatement should, at the least, cause investors and Wall Street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so-called pro forma earnings, which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules. \nIn January, Enron told investors its ''recurring net income,'' as it calls its pro forma number, would be $1.70 to $1.75 a share this year. The company's share price rose to $82 when that forecast was made. \nRemarkably, Enron is still on course to hit that target. Yesterday's restatement raised its nine-month earnings figure by a penny, to $1.36. And yet Enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $10 a share, or less than six times its reported profits, which still appear to be growing. Why so little? \nThe answer may be that Enron's board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance. Enron's failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring. And Enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid. So it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago. Don't call it a takeover. Takeunder would be a better term. \nWhat set off Enron's collapse? It now appears to have been a mistake. Enron says it added $1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error. The mistake did nothing to improve Enron's profits at the time, so it seems unlikely it was deliberate. Had the mistake not been made, the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $200 million, not $1.2 billion. That reduction scared investors into believing that Enron's transactions with partnerships led by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, had been disastrous for the company. Now it appears they may not have been so bad. \nBut that fact is not very important now. Enron's new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the Fastow partnerships. Such profits may be legal under accounting rules, but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are. \nIn fact, the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that may be important to Enron. The body charged with dealing with new accounting issues got a rush question on Oct. 23 -- the day before Enron ousted Mr. Fastow -- about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical ''Big Energy Corporation'' where one subsidiary, a natural gas pipeline company, trades with another subsidiary, an energy trading entity. The question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one. That company may or may not be Enron. \nSuch games will not work anymore, at least for Enron. It needs to be acquired because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers.\n\nGraph shows Enron share prices since Oct. 15. \nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Each embodied a sharply different approach to making money, attracting investors and winning over regulators.\nEnron thrived on risk, hurling itself into projects and businesses largely untested by others, earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of its murky accounting. \nDynegy is the slower, more cautious company, the younger sibling that carefully gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher Enron. Dynegy's steady progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibillion-dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor. \nAs one senior energy industry executive said, ''Enron's trying to hit more triples and home runs, while Dynegy tries for singles and doubles.'' \nKenneth Lay, the Enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies -- and whose influential friends include President Bush -- is the one who points to the bleachers. Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, Charles L. Watson, is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts. He also started small, nurturing his energy trading and generating company -- which had $33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30 -- from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid-80's. \nWhen electricity markets around the United States were deregulated, the companies followed clearly divergent paths. Utilities no longer necessarily generated power, and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity. Enron and Dynegy traded and marketed energy. Yet Enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power, a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast. \nDynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy. It cashed in, too, on deregulation, but not as Enron had. It stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations, retail power marketing, a water business and a broadband venture, most of which have gone badly awry. \nMr. Watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced. ''We need a little bit everywhere,'' he said. ''Enron is a financial player, but Dynegy is more of a physical player.'' \nIf Enron's finances grew more confusing, Dynegy seemed to offer clarity. If Enron promised a lot, analysts said, Dynegy played up its accomplishments. Enron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly, while Dynegy kept things quiet and discreet. \n''Chuck Watson is a pretty straight-talking guy,'' said Christopher R. Ellinghaus, a Williams Capital Group analyst. \nBecause Enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill, some analysts said, it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creative accounting. While Dynegy avoided such a path, no one really expects Mr. Watson to gloat about his company's new, larger stature. Enron may have been less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine, and it is unclear who will take on that role now. \n''Dynegy had what could be called a second-mover advantage,'' said Andre Meade, head of Commerzbank Securities' United States utility research. ''It seemed to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in Houston, Enron, go into a market. And if it was successful, Dynegy then could go in with less money and make it work.''\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN\n\n11/09/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 1, Column 2\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\n\nThe Enron Corporation yesterday sliced more than half a billion dollars from its reported profits over the last five years, but its crosstown rival, Dynegy Inc., still appeared to be willing to acquire Enron, executives close to the merger talks said. \nWorries about how bond rating agencies would react to the merger delayed announcement of the deal, the executives said. But the failure to announce a deal -- as well as the profit restatement -- caused Enron's share price to fall. And volume in its core North American natural gas and electricity trading operation plunged 20 percent as other energy-trading companies, unnerved by Enron's financial distress, steered business elsewhere.\nThe boards of the two companies tentatively agreed late Wednesday night to a deal in which Dynegy would acquire Enron for about $8 billion in stock, or roughly $10 a share. \nThe deal would include an initial $1.5 billion cash infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, and later an additional infusion of $1 billion. \nThe sticking point to proceeding with the deal, according to the executives, is whether Enron's credit rating will be reduced to ''junk'' status by the major credit rating agencies in reaction to Enron's disclosures and its plan to be acquired by Dynegy. \nDynegy and Enron have provided pro forma statements of what a combined Dynegy-Enron would look like and asked Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service for an ''expedited review'' of the transaction. \nDynegy and ChevronTexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a bigger cash infusion to buoy Enron's credit rating -- now just two notches from falling below investment grade -- if the agencies look askance at the current deal. The companies are hoping for a response within the next day or two, the executives said. \nThe executives also said Dynegy was seeking further protections that would allow it to back out of the deal if new, adverse disclosures surfaced. \nShares of Dynegy rose sharply yesterday, although it was not clear whether buyers believed that the company -- one-quarter the size of Enron, in terms of revenues -- was getting a bargain or that Enron's latest disclosures would lead to the deal's being abandoned. Dynegy rose $3.50, or 10.6 percent, to $36.50, gaining back all of the ground lost on Wednesday after news of the deal leaked. Enron shares fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, to $8.41. Less than a year ago, Enron traded for more than $84 a share, and the company was valued at nearly $70 billion. \nIn a sweeping restatement of its profits, Enron said that its actual net income for the years 1997 to 2000 was $591 million less than it had reported on its financial statements. In a filing with the S.E.C., Enron also indicated that part of last year's reported profits came from transactions with partnerships controlled by Andrew S. Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was ousted Oct. 24. \nEnron said the transactions involving Mr. Fastow, which are part of the S.E.C. investigation, earned the former executive more than $30 million. The company also said it had fired its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions, who both had invested in one of the partnerships. \nAny deal would also face long and complex reviews by federal and state energy regulators, who would have to sort out a range of competitive issues in the still-young business of wholesale natural gas and electricity trading. Among the agencies involved would be the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. \nSome analysts expressed hope that Enron's financial straits would encourage regulators to clear any deal, to relieve government officials of the prospect of dealing with the potential collapse of the nation's dominant energy-trading company. Enron handles about a quarter of all power trading, and higher proportions in some important regional markets. \n''If not for the dire condition of Enron today, we are not certain an Enron-Dynegy merger would be possible due to antitrust concerns,'' said Christopher R. Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital. ''However, the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the F.T.C., and would probably be looked at with some relief by the F.E.R.C.'' \nIt was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal. ''If Dynegy and Enron were to get together, obviously the thing that would appeal to Dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities, and that in itself would provide greater market power, not less market power,'' said Raymond Plank, chairman of the Apache Corporation, one of the largest independent natural gas producers, based in Houston. \nMr. Plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal. ''The thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility, and as a result, once again is threatening North American gas producers.'' \nEnron's restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997, and reduced it for every year since. But the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $5 million. \nThe changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent -- companies called Jedi and Chewco, after characters in the ''Star Wars'' movies -- and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called LJM1. That partnership, and another called LJM2, were run by Mr. Fastow. \nThe remainder of the earnings reductions, totaling $92 million from 1997 through 2000, came from what Enron called ''prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications,'' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditors, but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial. Details of those charges were not disclosed, and Enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions. \n''This is an unfortunate situation,'' said David Tabolt, a spokesman for Arthur Andersen, which audited Enron's books in all the years in question. ''Issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on Enron's financial statements or our audit reports. We are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters.'' \nWhile the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the LJM1 subsidiary, they did not fold the entire LJM1 partnership or the LJM2 partnership into Enron's financials. It is not clear how those partnerships performed. Nor did they include some other related entities whose Enron-guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors. \nMr. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, could not be reached for comment, his lawyer said. \nEnron's downward cascade began after it reported third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16. Its share price rose 67 cents, to $33.84, that day, as the company said its ''recurring net income'' had met analyst expectations, even though write-offs led to a net loss. \nIn a conference call that day, Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the LJM partnerships. In the following days, that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement. \nBut Enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $200 million, with the remaining $1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year. \nEnron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the LJM partnerships and assure they were proper. ''Whether these controls were properly implemented'' is being investigated by the special board committee, the company said. That committee has retained William McLucas, a former director of enforcement for the S.E.C., as well as accountants from Deloitte & Touche. \nThe company had disclosed that Mr. Fastow was involved with the LJM partnerships, but it had not reported that any other Enron officials were involved. Yesterday it said that three officers of the company, as well as another employee, had invested in an LJM1 subsidiary in March 2000. The officers were Ben Glisen, the company's treasurer; Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of an Enron division; and Kathy Lynn, vice president of an Enron division. The company said Ms. Lynn no longer worked for Enron and that the company was ''terminating the employment'' of the other two. \nSome industry officials said yesterday that a deal with Dynegy was increasingly looking like a do-or-die prospect for Enron, as other energy-trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies. While Enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets, by far its most valuable franchise is its energy-trading business in North America, which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company. \nYesterday, volume in that business dropped 20 percent. An Enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the S.E.C. investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with Dynegy. \nEnron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in Houston, executives said. The agenda for the meeting had been an extension of its $3 billion credit lines, but the merger talks superseded that discussion.\n\nPhoto: Dynegy's chief executive, Charles L.

Emshwiller and Kathryn Kranhold\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\n\n01/16/2002\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA4\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nA now highly publicized August 2001 letter from an Enron Corp. executive ra=\nising serious questions about the company's business and accounting practic=\nes was actually one of the later shots fired in an internal struggle that h=\nad been going on inside the energy-trading company for a year or more.=20\nThe letter to Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay from S=\nherron Watkins, a company vice president, detailed what she saw as the huge=\n financial and public-relations risks facing the company. Extensive dealing=\ns with partnerships that had been set up and run by some of the company's o=\nwn executives could cause Enron to \"implode,\" she wrote. Widespread disclos=\nure of those partnerships in the media beginning in October played a key ro=\nle in a collapse in investor confidence that eventually forced Enron to see=\nk bankruptcy-law protection.\nMs. Watkins's attorney, Philip Hilder, declined to discuss details of the l=\netter. But he said his client likely would cooperate with some of the gover=\nnment investigations into the Enron collapse. \"She has a compelling story a=\nnd I expect she'll have an opportunity to tell that story,\" Mr. Hilder said=\n.=20\nBut the story behind Ms. Watkins's letter is much more than that. It involv=\nes a power struggle over the direction of Enron as it committed itself to t=\nhe extremely unusual and tangled partnership structures that eventually con=\ntributed to its undoing. People familiar with that struggle say the issues =\nranged from the ethics of Enron's actions to a battle for the job of chief =\nfinancial officer at the Houston-based energy-trading company. The partners=\nhips -- called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP -- were formed in 19=\n99 by then Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who also ran the entities=\n and owned part of them. From the beginning, Mr. Fastow, Mr. Lay and other =\ntop company officials said the LJM partnerships were designed to do busines=\ns deals with Enron and help the energy company manage its financial risk.=\n=20\nHowever, other Enron officials were extremely skeptical about the partnersh=\nips, say company insiders and others familiar with the matter. For one thin=\ng, they saw inherent conflicts of interest in having the company's chief fi=\nnancial officer standing to financially benefit from business deals done wi=\nth Enron by an outside partnership that he headed. Late last year, Enron es=\ntimated that Mr. Fastow made more than $30 million from the LJM partnership=\ns.=20\nOne of the chief critics was Jeffrey McMahon, who in March 2000 took his co=\nncerns about LJM to then Enron President Jeffrey Skilling. Mr. Skilling did=\nn't share those concerns and soon after the meeting Mr. McMahon left his jo=\nb as corporate treasurer for another executive post within Enron.=20\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling says Mr. McMahon merely voiced worry about w=\nhether his own compensation might be affected if he had to negotiate deals =\non the opposite side of the table from LJM. Mr. McMahon \"never raised any b=\nroader concerns,\" she said.=20\n"}, "op_id": "24a4e4976d", "logical_op_id": "fde16923e7", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 7.510185241699219e-05, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null, "image_operation": null, "op_details": {"outputSchema": "TextFile(contents, filename)", "dataset_id": "enron-eval"}}, {"record_id": "096b7549bd", "record_parent_id": null, "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/martin-t-inbox-14-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "martin-t-inbox-14-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <2943840.1075841146795.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 6 Feb 2002 06:47:29 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nTo: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nSubject: Enron Mentions (major papers only) -- 02/06/02\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SPALME2>\nX-To: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spalme2>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Martin, Thomas A.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: MARTIN-T\nX-FileName: tom martin 6-25-02.PST\n\n\nQuestioning the Books: Enron Official Failed to Warn Participants Of 401(k)=\n Plan\nThe Wall Street Journal, 02/06/2002\n\nENRON EXECUTIVES SAY THEY DEBATED FREEZE ON PENSION\nThe New York Times, 02/06/2002\n\nRich Employee, Poor Employee; Senate Panel Looking at Pensions Shown Both S=\nides of the Enron Coin\nThe Washington Post, 02/06/2002\n\nExecs say they tried to protect workers' money=20\nHouston Chronicle, 02/06/2002\n\nEnron CEO Felt 'Betrayed,' Panel Told; Head of Internal Probe Testifies on =\nthe Hill\nThe Washington Post, 02/06/2002\n\nEnron Officials Sought Lawyer's Dismissal Over Negotiations With Outside Pa=\nrtnership\nThe Wall Street Journal, 02/06/2002\n\nThe Financial Wizard Tied to Enron's Fall\nThe New York Times, 02/06/2002\nEnron CEO Felt 'Betrayed,' Panel Told; Head of Internal Probe Testifies on =\nthe Hill\nThe Washington Post, 02/06/2002\n\n$270 Million Man Stays in the Background\nThe Washington Post, 02/06/2002\n\nEnron Execs Sold Stock as Losses Grew Probe: The $44-million sell-off came =\namid concern that problems at partnerships could become public.

Ms. Olson=\n said Ms. Watkins also sought out Jeffrey McMahon, currently Enron's chief =\noperating officer, who was then its treasurer, for guidance at the time.\nEnron's retirement plans, decimated by the collapse of the Houston energy c=\noncern, will come under further scrutiny in Congress this week. Today, Labo=\nr Secretary Elaine Chao testifies before the House Education and Workforce =\nCommittee about whether retirement-plan rules should change in the wake of =\nEnron's collapse; tomorrow the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor=\n and Pensions will hear from former Enron workers.=20\nIn yesterday's hearing, Ms. Olson said she didn't share Ms. Watkins's alleg=\nations with the other 401(k) plan trustees because she didn't feel it was h=\ner responsibility to repeat \"hearsay.\" In addition, she said, Ms. Watkins h=\nad come to her in confidence. After Ms. Watkins took her concerns to Mr. La=\ny and he ordered an investigation, \"I felt it was all in good hands,\" Ms. O=\nlson said.=20\nEli Gottesdiener, a Washington-based lawyer representing Enron workers, cou=\nntered those arguments. \"She had information that affected the lives of 10,=\n000 people and did nothing,\" he said, adding, \"It's so clear that she breac=\nhed her duty.\" He said Ms. Olson should have convened an emergency meeting =\nof the trustees to inform them of Ms. Watkins's allegations so that they co=\nuld launch their own investigation. The trustees immediately could have sto=\npped offering Enron stock as an investment option, and stopped using Enron =\nstock as a matching contribution in the retirement plan.=20\nMs. Olson testified that the plan trustees felt that they didn't have the a=\nbility to change the plan design without approval from the board of directo=\nrs.=20\nMs. Olson herself sold much of her own Enron holdings, most before she knew=\n of Ms. Watkins's concerns, but some afterward. Responding to sharp questio=\nning from lawmakers, including Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democra=\nt who heads the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Ms. Olson acknowledg=\ned she sold 83,000 Enron shares for $6.5 million, the bulk from December 20=\n00 to March 2001. She said she decided to sell the shares after having a fa=\nlling out with former Enron President Jeffrey Skilling over their different=\n management styles. Thinking about leaving the company, she said, she went =\nto a financial adviser who advised her to diversify her portfolio; at his s=\nuggestion, she said, she put the proceeds from selling her Enron shares int=\no government bonds.=20\nA few days before Enron filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, Ms=\n. Olson said she sold an additional 3,000 Enron shares that were in her emp=\nloyee stock ownership plan, for $2 each. She said she didn't have knowledge=\n of the bankruptcy, but suspected the possibility.=20\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Lieberman said he would issue subpoenas to gather m=\nore information about the alleged payment of $105 million in bonuses to man=\nagement around the time Enron filed for Chapter 11, and the company's alleg=\ned failure to pay workers severance pay, beyond a one-time $4,500 payment.=\n=20\nAs Enron shares plunged last fall, the company also considered postponing a=\n planned \"blackout\" during which time employees wouldn't be able to change =\ntheir investments or sell Enron stock, said Ms. Olson and Enron benefits ma=\nnager Mikie Rath. Ms. Olson said she finally decided against a delay after =\nconsulting with other Enron executives and an outside lawyer several days b=\nefore the scheduled blackout that began on Oct. 26 last year and lasted for=\n about 10 trading days. She said the lawyer had advised Enron to go ahead w=\nith the blackout, on the grounds that it wouldn't be able to notify in time=\n all employees -- specifically about 11,000 retirees and other workers base=\nd outside of the Houston headquarters -- about a potential postponement.=20\nExecutives from Northern Trust Retirement Consulting LLC and Hewitt Associa=\ntes LLC, the companies that managed Enron's 401(k) plans, confirmed that th=\ney were contacted about the possibility of delaying the blackout period.=20\nMs. Olson said Enron hired counsel in early November to seek legal advice o=\nn whether it \"made sense\" to advise employees on selling their Enron stockh=\noldings.=20\nThis week's hearings are intended to generate more information for lawmaker=\ns who will decide whether retirement plans ought to be more carefully regul=\nated. House Energy and Commerce Chairman W.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin (R., La.) says=\n a top priority this year will be legislation aimed at protecting workers s=\nuch as those at Enron. \"Clearly, we need pension reform,\" Mr. Tauzin, the l=\neading congressional investigator into Enron, said in an interview.=20\nHowever, retirement-plan experts say any significant change will be an uphi=\nll battle, as employer groups, Republicans, and the Bush administration opp=\nose an overhaul -- in particular, any limits on company stock in retirement=\n plans.=20\nSomewhat less controversial are proposals, by Democrats and more recently b=\ny President Bush and Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Ben Cardin (D., Md.), that =\nwould provide employees greater ability to diversify out of stock contribut=\ned by their employer. Many employers now lock workers into such shares unti=\nl age 50 or later.=20\nOn this issue, there may be more opportunity for compromise, since so far, =\nall proposals still leave employers with the freedom to lock employees into=\n company stock for long periods. Mr. Bush's proposal has the weakest divers=\nification provisions, as it exempts many defined contribution savings plans=\n from proposed diversification rules, particularly ESOPs, which hundreds of=\n large employers use. Consequently, employers could continue to lock worker=\ns into company stock in many plans until age 55 and later.=20\n---=20\nGreg Hitt contributed to this article.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09\n\nBusiness/Financial Desk; Section A\nENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE OVERVIEW\nENRON EXECUTIVES SAY THEY DEBATED FREEZE ON PENSION\nBy STEVEN GREENHOUSE and STEPHEN LABATON\n\n02/06/2002\nThe New York Times\nPage 1, Column 1\nc. 2002 New York Times Company\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb. 5 -- Enron executives acknowledged today that before they =\ntemporarily prevented employees from selling company stock in their retirem=\nent accounts last fall, the executives had sharply debated delaying the mor=\natorium because employees could suffer heavy losses from a plunging stock p=\nrice.=20\n''We were concerned in the benefits department about the deterioration of t=\nhe stock price,'' Mikie Rath, a benefits manager at Enron, said in testimon=\ny before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. But after the debate on=\n the eve of the moratorium, they imposed the so-called blackout period to g=\nive themselves time to replace the administrators of the retirement plan.\nEnron executives said they decided it would be too hard to notify the parti=\ncipants in the company's 401(k) plan immediately. They also said they feare=\nd they would open themselves to lawsuits by plan participants who were noti=\nfied about the delay later than others for reasons like mail delays.=20\nThe disclosures on the pension plan came as other Congressional committees =\ntook up Enron matters.=20\nHouse and Senate lawmakers issued subpoenas to compel the testimony of Enro=\nn's former chief executive, Kenneth L.

The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu. The mark=\net dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the session bet=\nween $2.10  $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as locals sold down =\nthe contract to the $2.07 support level and went home short. The AGA will r=\nelease this weeks storage report this afternoon, and while some traders are=\n predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf withdrawal, look for the numbe=\nr to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in the Midwest and Texas, the growi=\nng differential between cash and futures, and the perceived premium in the =\nearly March contract have kept the market from dropping further. Physical p=\nrices retained their premium over futures yesterday on short-term cold weat=\nher at some pipelines, maintaining about a $0.07  $0.10 premium over the NY=\nMEX. But cash traders expect the demand to ease quickly as temperatures mod=\nerate by t! his weekend. As usual, the market will look to the weekly stora=\nge report for short term direction, but it is the massive amount of volumes=\n still in storage compared to last year that has put a cap on longer term p=\nrice increases.

In testimony before the House Ene=\nrgy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that Enron had a $500 million loss =\nin March. Rather than report it to shareholders, Enron gave a partnership c=\nalled Raptor another $800 million in Enron shares. He said that there is no=\n doubt that almost everyone, from the board of directors on down, knew that=\n the company was attempting to offset investment losses with stock. The par=\ntnerships allowed Enron to misrepresent earnings for a period spanning the =\n3rd quarter of 2000 through the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers t=\nold that committee that over 70% of Enrons earnings for that period were fa=\nlse. He said that there were red flags that should have alerted former chai=\nrman Ken L! ay to what was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely under=\nstood that Enron was using its own stock to offset the losses in the partne=\nrships.=20\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFAST.

Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\n\n02/01/2002\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA1\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nHOUSTON -- On Nov. 5, 1997, the top echelon of Enron Corp. assembled for a =\nmeeting that would help put the energy-trading giant on a fateful and ultim=\nately disastrous course.=20\nOn that day, Enron's now-infamous outside partnership arrangements took a t=\nurn from the straightforward and mundane to the deceptive and possibly ille=\ngal. The seven-member executive committee of the company's board approved a=\n management proposal to provide several hundred million dollars in loan gua=\nrantees for a new partnership named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.\nWhile Enron had done business with previous partnerships, Chewco Investment=\ns was different. Unlike others where Enron had an ownership stake, Chewco w=\nas supposed to be completely independent. But it would be run and partly ow=\nned by an Enron executive, a young rising star named Michael Kopper.=20\nEnron Chairman Kenneth Lay arrived a little late, according to minutes of t=\nhe meeting obtained by The Wall Street Journal. He came in while Andrew Fas=\ntow, then senior vice president of finance, outlined a transaction that wou=\nld allow Chewco to buy, for $383 million, part of Enron's stake in another =\nlimited partnership known as JEDI. The deal kept JEDI in the Enron family, =\nbut off its books. That's because under accounting rules, Chewco provided e=\nnough independent ownership of JEDI to let Enron treat it as separate.=20\nHowever, with Enron financial guarantees and an Enron official at the helm,=\n there were questions from the beginning of how independent Chewco really w=\nas. Chewco thus set the pattern for a series of transactions that would mas=\nsively inflate Enron's earnings, while hiding billions in debt from shareho=\nlders and creditors.=20\nFour years later, on Nov. 8 last year, Enron acknowledged in a federal fili=\nng that it had overstated earnings by nearly $600 million since 1997. About=\n two-thirds of that, it told the Securities and Exchange Commission, was be=\ncause Chewco and JEDI had improperly been treated as separate entities able=\n to do income-producing deals with Enron. The disclosure sent a signal that=\n Enron hadn't been playing straight, and what had been an exodus of investo=\nrs and trading partners turned into a stampede. Within a month, Enron sough=\nt bankruptcy-law protection.=20\nFederal investigators and private litigators are now intently trying to lea=\nrn who knew what about Chewco, and when. Top former officials have distance=\nd themselves from it. In October, after the Journal first disclosed Chewco'=\ns existence, Mr. Lay privately told other Enron officials that he had never=\n heard of the partnership, according to one company executive. His wife, Li=\nnda Lay, told NBC recently that her husband had been kept in the dark about=\n a lot of the company's doings. Mr. Lay, who resigned from Enron last month=\n, couldn't be reached for comment and his attorney didn't return calls.=20\nJeffrey Skilling, who resigned suddenly as Enron's chief executive last sum=\nmer, said in press interviews late in December that he knew few details abo=\nut the partnership. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling said, \"We are=\nn't going to comment on leaks, counter-leaks, spin or speculation.\" An atto=\nrney for Mr. Kopper declined to comment. An attorney for Mr. Fastow said on=\nly that his client didn't have any financial interest in Chewco.=20\nThe meeting's minutes and other recently obtained documents show plenty of =\npeople at Enron knew about Chewco. Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Fastow were pa=\nrt of the 1997 executive-committee meeting. So were several board members. =\nOne -- Herbert \"Pug\" Winokur Jr., chairman of Capricorn Holdings Inc. in Gr=\neenwich, Conn. -- felt comfortable enough with Chewco that he approved its =\ncreation from an airport while boarding a flight.=20\nW. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for Mr. Winokur and other outside directors,=\n says the executive committee was told that \"Chewco was a special-purpose v=\nehicle not affiliated with the company. The board never waived the conflict=\n-of-interest policy for Mr. Kopper nor was the board told that Mr. Kopper w=\nas involved with Chewco.\" The meeting minutes indicate that Mr. Kopper was =\nin attendance, though the document misspells his name. The minutes don't sh=\now whether he was introduced or took part.=20\nDuring the presentation about Chewco, the meeting minutes say, Mr. Fastow \"=\nreviewed the economics of the project, the financing arrangements and the c=\norporate structure.\" Among the benefits the partnership was supposed to bri=\nng was \"positive income impact to Enron,\" according to a handout appended t=\no the minutes. The handout included diagrams of the complex financial struc=\nture.=20\nChewco isn't an issue just for Enron. Joseph Berardino, chief executive of =\nlongtime Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP, told Congress in December that =\nhis firm never would have let Enron treat Chewco and JEDI as arm's-length, =\nseparate entities had it known the entire truth about the entities' financi=\nng arrangements. At the time Chewco was being formed, Enron officials told =\nBarclays PLC, a lender involved in the deal, that Andersen had reviewed the=\n transaction's structure and approved it, according to someone familiar wit=\nh the discussions.=20\nA Barclays spokesman declines to comment. Andersen says Mr. Berardino, who =\nis scheduled to testify again next week before a House committee, stands by=\n his statement that his firm didn't know all the relevant facts about Chewc=\no four years ago.=20\nChewco altered a financial tool long used by the energy industry. Enron had=\n at times relied on off-balance-sheet partnerships and similar entities, as=\n had many competitors. Traditional \"off-balance-sheet financing is the tech=\nnique that has been used to build the independent power industry in the Uni=\nted States,\" says Didi Lacher, a New York executive of the German financial=\n firm Helaba. With such entities, companies can share the cost and risk of =\ndeveloping, say, a well or pipeline. By having the partnership borrow the m=\noney, the company can also keep the debt off its own balance sheet.=20\nThis financing is \"nonrecourse,\" meaning the sponsoring company isn't on th=\ne hook for the debt. But Enron kept off its balance sheet some debt in whic=\nh it had to cover any shortfalls, because of the partnerships' arrangements=\n. Over time, Enron accumulated billions of dollars of potential liability, =\nlittle of it publicly evident.=20\nTo do outside partnerships, some basic accounting guidelines have to be fol=\nlowed. The company has to relinquish control of any assets put into the par=\ntnership. It can't have side deals that oblige it to repurchase or redeem t=\nhe assets during the partnerships' lives, typically five to 10 years. Since=\n 1996, a partnership also has had to attract outside equity equal to at lea=\nst 3% of its total capital in order to be considered separate from the spon=\nsoring company. Enron's partnerships appear to have met these standards for=\n many years, but eventually Enron started to look at a higher-octane partne=\nrship.=20\nEnron under Mr. Lay assembled a team of bright young executives intent on b=\nuilding a global energy power. Led by Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co.=\n consultant, the core of the team started working together at Enron Capital=\n and Trade Resources, which handled energy trading and marketing. His lieut=\nenants included Mr. Fastow, a former Continental Bank finance specialist, a=\nnd Richard Causey, a former Andersen official.=20\nThey figured that for Enron to grow quickly, it couldn't be weighed down wi=\nth debt. Too much debt would threaten the company's credit rating and make =\nits financing costs higher.=20\nMr. Skilling and his subordinates placed an emphasis on rapid-fire trading =\nand deal-making, rather than on long-term investments in power plants and o=\nther \"hard\" assets.

Daniel Bayly, Merrill's investment-banking chief; and Schuyler Tilney, who heads Merrill's energy investment-banking department and directly oversees the firm's dealing with Enron on corporate-finance matters, the people said.\nThough each executive invested less than $1 million, the people said, their involvement highlights the role played by senior Wall Street officials in helping to create some of the partnerships Enron used to pad its earnings and hide debt from investors -- and that eventually resulted in huge losses that led to the energy-trading company's downfall. \nMr. Davis, Mr. Tilney and Mr. Bayly didn't return calls for comment. Joseph Cohen, a Merrill spokesman, said the investments were entirely appropriate, and common on Wall Street. \nThe personal investments were part of a total of $22 million Merrill and its officials committed to invest in the partnership, known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. This partnership was particularly controversial because it allowed some Enron officials to make far more money working part time on the partnerships than they did working full time for Enron. The energy company has estimated, for instance, that Andrew Fastow, whom Enron replaced as chief financial officer in October as pressures on the company mounted, made more than $30 million since 1999 running LJM2 and a smaller partnership, called LJM Cayman LP. \nAt issue for Merrill is the potential for conflicts of interest. Merrill, like other Wall Street firms, wore a number of hats with Enron: The securities firm acted at various times as securities underwriter and investor with the energy company. Since 1990, Merrill was among the top five underwriters of Enron's stock and bond deals, according to Thomson Financial, earning fees for helping to raise about $3.7 billion in securities issues for the company. Thus, some critics question whether Merrill officials would let their personal investments with Enron entities interfere with their business decisions in dealing with the energy company. \n\"Merrill's involvement as underwriter for Enron and its executives' investments raises serious conflict-of-interest questions,\" says Jacob Zamansky, a New York-based plaintiffs' lawyer. \"It gives the appearance that Merrill did this to get Enron deals. Merrill had a vested interest in . . . the partnership and investing\" in it. \nThere are other conflicts as well, securities lawyers say. Some top executives at Merrill declined to invest their money because they believed that the Enron partnership -- which kept assets off Enron's balance sheet -- wouldn't get the best investments, which would be kept by the corporate parent. Another concern: Enron's Mr. Fastow suggested the idea of investing in the partnership to Mr. Tilney, whose wife until last week was a managing director of Enron's energy-services unit. Mr. Fastow through a spokesman had no comment. \nIt is unclear if top Merrill executives, who also worked on Enron's financings, had more information about the nature of the LJM2 partnership than Merrill's individual customers who were offered opportunities to invest in the partnership. \"I'm not saying that Merrill violated the law here,\" says John Coffee, a professor of securities law at Columbia University in New York. \"But this is a big public-policy issue. Merrill has an obligation, because Enron is a client, not to reveal some confidential information, but it also has a fiduciary obligation to its investors to tell them if these securities aren't suitable for them.\" \nMr. Cohen, the Merrill spokesman, brushes aside such concerns. \"The investment partnership was reviewed and deemed appropriate by parties on all sides of the transaction,\" Mr. Cohen said, reading from a prepared statement. \"Consistent with common industry practice, it was offered to qualified external as well as internal investors, and this is not a conflict of interest.\" \nMr. Cohen added that Merrill high-net-worth clients \"in the partnership offering were given the same information as all Merrill executives who wanted to invest.\" \nMr. Davis, who at the time of the investment headed the institutional-securities group, appears to be the only official on Merrill's executive committee to have invested in the partnership. Even though close to 100 Merrill executives invested in the partnership, neither Chief Executive Officer David Komansky nor his heir apparent, President E. Stanley O'Neal, were in the group, people close to the deal said. One person with knowledge of the matter said some top executives balked at investing their own money because they were uncomfortable with some LJM2 investments. Mr. Davis, however, headed the institutional group, which counted Enron as one of its big clients. \nMerrill, which helped market LJM2 to more than three dozen institutional and individual investors, was only one of many Wall Street firms to invest in the $386.6 million partnership. Other corporate investors in the partnership included Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., two units of Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., First Union Corp. and the CIBC World Markets unit of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \nThe funds for a $15 million investment from J.P. Morgan Chase came from the private-equity unit of J.P. Morgan, which invests the firm's own funds. While individual Morgan bankers may have stakes in those funds, they didn't have any direct, separate stakes in LJM2, a spokeswoman said. \nAt Citigroup and Lehman Brothers, which committed $10 million each, and CIBC World Markets, which committed $15 million, the funds came from the firms' own assets and not from outside clients or individual investment bankers, according to people familiar with the investments. \nOfficials declined to comment at CSFB, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, whose DLJ Fund Investment Partners III LP made a $5 million commitment, while a CSFB affiliate named Merchant Capital Inc. committed $10 million. Company representatives had no comment at Deutsche Bank, where an affiliate of its former Bankers Trust unit, BT Investment Partners, committed $10 million, and First Union, whose First Union Investors Inc. committed $25 million. \nOfficials at some of these Wall Street firms said their investment committees felt pressured to make the investments in order to stay in the running for investment-banking assignments. Some bankers were concerned about whether they were being asked to make uneconomical investments in corporate castoffs that wouldn't appreciate in value. Indeed, it is unclear what returns, if any, the LJM2 partnership investment has generated for limited partners and investors. \nWall Street securities firms have long made investments associated with their investment-banking business. Sometimes the investments are made to provide extra capital to help clients complete deals. Sometimes the investments are used to acquire an asset a client wants to sell. The funds may come from the securities firm itself, from investment clients, or individuals at the firm who may be offered the chance to make the investments as part of their compensation packages. \nWhat was unusual about the Merrill investment in the Enron vehicle was that some senior bankers chose not to participate out of concern about what the partnership would invest in. In addition, some of Merrill's top executives, including Mr. Komansky, Merrill's chief executive, had been embarrassed in 1998 by disclosure that they had taken personal stakes in Long-Term Capital Management, the highflying hedge fund for which Merrill had raised funds and whose near collapse jeopardized the entire U.S. financial system.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

A case study in corporate rot.\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\nBy Jake Tapper\nJan. 29, 2002 | When she heard that Kristina Mordaunt had been mixed up in Enron's infamous LJM partnership, Julia Murray broke down in tears. \nMurray, an Enron in-house counsel, wasn't known within the firm for such emotional displays. Enron was a hard-charging company that attracted tough-as-nails Type A executives and lawyers. But Kristina Mordaunt, a fellow Enron attorney who had worked in the counsel's office before joining the company's financial division, was Murray's close friend. And the news about her was rather shocking: On Nov. 7, 2001, Mordaunt was fired and escorted from the Enron building in downtown Houston by company security. According to four current or former Enron executives, Mordaunt was fired after the company found that she had made a windfall profit off LJM, one of the controversial -- and possibly illegal -- partnerships set up by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. \nAccording to these sources, there is a lesson in Kristina Mordaunt's downfall. The ignominious exit of employees like Mordaunt, who had enjoyed the trust and respect of fellow company attorneys and managers, shows how Enron's corporate culture rotted from within, under the twin pressures of financial ambition and personal greed. \nA few weeks before Mordaunt was fired, Enron had announced that her former boss Fastow was on a \"leave of absence.\" But few inside the company expected him back. On Oct. 31, Enron had reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission had upgraded its interest in the company's financial dealings from an inquiry to a formal investigation. Within Enron, the board of directors set up a special internal committee to investigate the company's convoluted finances as well. Soon, according to the four Enron sources, the committee stumbled upon stunning news: Working with Fastow, Mordaunt and Enron treasurer Ben Glisan had invested around $6,000 apiece in LJM, one of the limited partnerships Enron had established to hide its debt. Within a few weeks, they each made approximately $1 million from those investments. Enron later revealed that Fastow himself, the financial wizard behind the partnerships scheme, earned as much as $30 million from his role in managing the partnerships. \nDue to Enron's complex -- some think purposely confusing -- financial arrangements, those numbers could not be confirmed with documentation, though they were reported to Salon by the four current or former Enron executives. A congressional investigator also informed Salon that his committee has been given the same information and is currently trying to verify the charge. \nWhat is clear is that Mordaunt and Glisan were key members of the team Fastow worked with to set up these questionable partnerships, and they appear to have benefited dramatically. \"Mordaunt, for all practical purposes, was Fastow's lawyer at Enron\" since she was \"the top lawyer in his division,\" at the time, said one former Enron executive. After working for Fastow, Mordaunt later became chief counsel for a separate Enron division called EBS -- which itself was involved in highly questionable accounting activities. \nMordaunt could not be reached for comment by Salon, but according to a former Enron employee, \"She has told people that she doesn't think she did anything wrong.\" \nGlisan declined to comment. \"I've been advised not to talk to anybody,\" he told Salon. Glisan referred calls to his attorney, Hank Schuelke, with the Washington, D.C., law firm Janis Schuelke & Wechsler. Asked about the allegation against Glisan, Bill Shields, an attorney with the firm, said only, \"We're not going to have any comment.\" \nSo far, according to the congressional investigator, the world knows \"just the tip of the iceberg\" about what drove Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, into the biggest U.S. bankruptcy of all time, depriving investors and employees of at least $1 billion. Up to this point, most of the public's attention has been focused on Enron's political connections and the failure of Wall Street's so-called gatekeepers -- the analysts, banks, credit agencies and analysts -- to sound a warning bell. But the inside story of Enron's corporate culture -- as the company transformed itself from an energy trader whose business was rooted in the physical delivery of gas and electricity into a high-finance wheeler-dealer whose business was primarily manipulating numbers -- is just coming to light. This part of the story is about greed, betrayal and deception -- and its human costs, in broken friendships, ruined careers and worse. \nThe apparent suicide of former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Baxter on Friday might be the most dramatic example so far of this human cost. But Enron's corporate ranks have been suffering many shocks since last fall -- and the revelation about Mordaunt and Glisan was one of them. Many executives were stunned to learn that these two trusted co-workers and friends had been raking in such extraordinary amounts of cash. Though Julia Murray declined to comment to Salon, her tearful reaction to the news about her friend Mordaunt last November indicate the deep emotional wounds inflicted by some of Enron's suddenly rich managers as they grabbed their cash and ran for the door.\n\"Did I feel betrayed? Yeah, a lot,\" said an Enron executive and friend of both Mordaunt and Glisan who would speak with Salon only on the condition of anonymity. \"I was extremely surprised.\" \nAfter the news about Mordaunt and Glisan broke inside the company, colleagues rushed to see who else might have been involved in the scandal. After Mordaunt was escorted out of the Enron building, said one executive, \"I called a number of people I know who work in the finance division and said, 'Please tell me that you didn't invest in LJM!\" \nLJM along with LJM2 and Chewco have become the most notorious of the shady accounting partnerships set up by Enron. Set up, it is now believed, specifically to hide Enron debt from public scrutiny, the partnerships proved to be the catalyst for Enron's fall. \nOn Nov. 8, 2001, the same day the company announced that its financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 \"should not be relied upon,\" Enron filed an \"8-K\" form -- an interim document required for certain types of financial events -- with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In that form, <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/> Enron disclosed that some of the \"limited partners\" in the partnerships \"were, at the time of the investment, non-executive officers or employees of Enron.\" Enron also announced that it was \"terminating the employment\" of Glisan and Mordaunt for participating in the LJM partnerships. \n\"At the time these individuals invested in the limited partnership, LJM1 had ceased entering into new transactions with Enron,\" Enron's 8-K stated. \"However, some pre-existing investments involving LJM1 and Enron were still in effect, and Enron believes that these investments resulted in distributions or payments to LJM1 and to the limited partnership in which these individuals invested.\" \nAccording to the congressional investigator, Mordaunt reaped her LJM windfall after she was approached by an Enron executive, who asked her if she wanted to make some money. Yes, she said. \"Give me a check for $6,000,\" he told her, according to the congressional investigator. Later, the executive asked Mordaunt for her bank account number so he could deposit the proceeds from her investment. \"How much is it?\" she asked. He told her to check her bank account the next day. When she did, she discovered over $1 million had been deposited into her account. The congressional committee is currently investigating the matter. \nThe Nov. 8 SEC filing also clarified Fastow's role in the company. He was no longer officially on a leave of absence. He \"is no longer working for Enron,\" the filing stated. \nAt a November news conference, then-CEO Kenneth Lay reported that he knew about the partnerships but not about Mordaunt's and Glisan's role in them. \nAsked last week about the allegations against Mordaunt and Glisan, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said, \"I have no idea.\" Palmer noted that a special committee had been appointed \"to look into\" such matters. \"I know they're looking into everything surrounding those transactions,\" he said, referring to the partnerships. \nSaid another former Enron executive after hearing about Mordaunt's and Glisan's lucrative deals: \"Hillary Clinton should have gone to their school of futures trading.\" \nTo many of their former colleagues, Mordaunt's and Glisan's closeness to Fastow's suspicious transactions makes things look even worse. \"To many of us, this looks and smells like a bribe,\" said one Enron former employee. \"'I' -- Fastow -- 'will give you money, you shut up.' Or put another way, 'Here is the payoff for helping me set up the structures that helped me rake in more than $30 million.'\" The two weren't merely \"Enron executives,\" the former employee says, \"they were the treasurer and one of the top lawyers in the company. And both of them worked on LJM-related deals. That is what makes it sickening.\" \nThe accusations highlight the personal betrayal many Enron executives feel. After Mordaunt and Glisan were fired last November, their former colleagues spent much time trying to figure out how it all could have happened. \nMordaunt, according to a current Enron executive, \"was very tight with Andy [Fastow]. Andy was responsible for making her managing director, and she would have done anything for him.\" Nonetheless, as a lawyer, Mordaunt should have known better, the executive said. \"Given his connection with LJM, which was dicey at best and at worst probably illegal, I personally would have stayed far away from it. But you never know how Andy spun it to her.\" \nAfter working as Fastow's top lawyer, Mordaunt later served as chief counsel for EBS, an Enron subsidiary set up specifically to handle another complex partnership, code-named Braveheart. In Braveheart, Enron sold 10 years' worth of future revenue from a broadband interactive television deal it was setting up with Blockbuster. Although the deal itself never went past the testing stage, Enron booked $110 million worth of revenue for selling off those future, never-to-be-realized earnings. \nGlisan also played a key role in Fastow's division, a former Enron executive noted: \"All the deals we did had to go through Glisan and get his approval because of the impact on funds flow.\" The former executive, like others affiliated with the firm, said that he once had a positive impression of Glisan and was surprised to learn that he had been an LJM investor. \nTo some current and former Enron executives, the transformation of respected managers like Mordaunt and Glisan represented a major shift in the company ethos. \"In my opinion this all goes back to when Jeff Skilling took over and Enron ceased being an energy company and we became an earnings company,\" said one former executive, referring to Enron's metamorphosis into a company that focused more on highly complex financial-derivatives trading than on actual commodities. \nIn 1997, Skilling became the company's president and chief operating officer. Press accounts of Enron's rise traditionally gave him credit for Enron's increasing focus on complex financing schemes and risky leaps into such areas as bandwidth trading, an enterprise that ended up costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars. \nSkilling was \"all hype,\" the one-time executive says. \"Everything he did was to hype the stock. And they had this need to create complex financial dealings to hide all the things going wrong. \n\"Once we became an earnings-focused company, that was the beginning of the end.\" The former executive said he's still unsure whether recently resigned CEO Lay knew everything that was going on. \"But that doesn't excuse him. Captain Joe Hazelwood didn't know that the guy was going to run the Valdez into the reef. But he was Captain Hazelwood. It was his ship.\" \nThe company's business practices changed under Skilling, this former executive said. And so did the attitudes of managers like Mordaunt and Glisan -- and Lay, for that matter. Keeping the stock price up, at all costs, became the order of the day, even if that meant telling employees all was fine, when in fact the company's situation was rapidly deteriorating. \n\"[Lay] lied to us starting in August,\" said the former executive. \"He lied to us.\" In August, Lay went before the company and announced that Skilling was resigning for personal reasons. In an all-employees meeting, Lay told a touching tale about why Skilling felt the need to leave the company. \nSkilling, Lay said, had recently visited the Teesside Power Station, Enron's gas-fired power plant in northeast England, where an Aug. 8 explosion and fire had killed three Enron employees. \"It shook him up so much he realized how much he had sacrificed with his own family,\" one executive recalled Lay saying. \"And he wanted to spend more time with his kids.\" Lay then told the company more lies, according to the executive: that Enron had just enjoyed the best quarter in its history; that it was going to be more friendly to Wall Street; it was going to simplify its accounting practices; there were no other people other than Fastow involved in the shady partnerships. \n\"About two weeks later, the news came out about Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt,\" recalled the executive. Soon afterward, the company was told that \"we would have to restate our earnings for the past five years.\" \nThen came the news that executives like Lay had been dumping their stock for years while simultaneously telling stockholders and employees that all was fine and the stock would soon bounce back. In hindsight, few Enron executives believe that Skilling's departure had anything to do with the Teesside Power Station tragedy. \n\"Lay got in front of the entire company and just lied,\" said the executive, who has lost his life savings. \"I feel like a schmuck.\" \n\nsalon.com \n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nA Section\nEnron Directors Backed Moving Debt Off Books\nKathleen Day and Peter Behr\nWashington Post Staff Writers\n\n01/31/2002\nThe Washington Post\nFINAL\nA01\nCopyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved\n\nMembers of Enron Corp.'s board of directors received detailed briefings as early as four years ago about the purpose and structure of controversial partnerships whose losses triggered the company's fall into bankruptcy, according to minutes of the meetings. \nThe minutes, which cover four board meetings in 1997 and 1999 and three meetings of the board's finance committee in 2000, suggest that board members approved aggressive accounting actions, including moving debt off the company books.\nA dozen congressional committees as well as the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's collapse, which cost investors and employees billions of dollars. A focus of the inquiries is whether Enron hid debt and inflated its profits by using the private partnerships run by its chief financial officer. \nIn other Enron-related news yesterday, the General Accounting Office announced that it would sue the White House for access to records of Vice President Cheney's meetings with Enron and other industry interests that sought to influence the administration's energy policy last year. And Stephen Cooper, the interim head of Enron, said he was optimistic the company could survive, though in a much diminished form. \nIndividual Enron board members, who themselves are being sued and investigated, have said little publicly about their role in the transactions that toppled the company. The minutes, made available to The Washington Post by a source critical of the board, suggest that the partnerships were a key part of Enron's growth strategy and show they were regularly reviewed by the directors. \nThe copies of the minutes do not cover every board meeting and do not include documents that are referred to as being attached to the summaries of the board's actions. \nWhen it was reported last fall that Andrew Fastow, the Enron CFO, made $30 million running partnerships with names such as LJM, Raptor and JEDI, then-chairman Kenneth L. Lay announced that the board was setting up a special committee to investigate. The minutes show that members of that special committee attended board meetings in which Fastow described the intricacy of the entities. \nSources said the committee's report, which is expected to be completed as early as tomorrow, will say that while the Enron board approved the partnerships, management and auditors withheld key information from them. That is expected to be the key element of the defense that will be offered by Lay and board member William C. Powers Jr. when they testify before Congress on Monday, sources said. Last night, Robert Bennett, a Washington lawyer representing Enron, gave every indication that would be the case. \n\"While the board of directors, including Mr. Lay, were aware that these special partnership entities were being set up, which were being run by Mr. Fastow, there is a great deal of information regarding their operation and execution that was unknown to the board of directors,\" Bennett said. \nAt an Oct. 11, 1999, board meeting, Fastow discussed the company's mix of \"on-balance and off-balance sheet debt,\" according to the minutes. At another meeting on May 1, 2000, Fastow told board members about the risk of \"accounting scrutiny\" on the Raptor partnership. \nA board resolution in October 1999 said one purpose of the LJM2 partnership was to create \"a potential ready purchaser of the company's businesses and assets.\" A chart labeled \"LJM2 Update,\" attached to the agenda for a May 2000 finance committee meeting, said the partnership had made seven investments, all purchased from Enron. \nEnron has disclosed that the board waived the company's conflict-of-interest rules to let Fastow oversee the partnerships. \nThe board's special committee hired William R. McLucas, former head of enforcement at the SEC, to do the investigation and write a report for the committee. The report is expected to be released before Lay, who resigned last week, and board member Powers, who is also dean of the University of Texas law school, testify before Congress on Monday. \nUntil now, Congress has focused on the role Enron's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, played in the company's collapse and the reported destruction by Andersen executives of Enron-related documents. Monday's hearings are expected to zero in on the behavior of Enron officials, including the board. \nThe outside directors are expected, as part of their defense, to push the focus back on Andersen, sources say. They will point, for example, to portions of board minutes that say Andersen \"had spent considerable time analyzing . . . the governance structure\" of one of the partnerships, LJM2, and \"was comfortable with the proposed transaction.\" \nMinutes from October 1999 and October 2000 say the board ordered several safeguards be implemented to maintain control of the partnerships. One was allowing Lay or the board to remove Fastow from one partnership, LJM, at any time. Another was directing then-Enron chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling and others to review all transactions between Enron and LJM. And Skilling was to review Fastow's \"economic interest\" in the partnership. \nBennett said, \"We have learned that many of the procedures that were put into place to ensure the appropriate operation of these entities were not complied with, without the knowledge of the board.\" \nPatrick McGurn of Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. of Rockville, which advises large shareholders on corporate-governance issues, said last night that the minutes seem to provide more evidence that board members were fully informed of the company's aggressive financial strategies. \n\"If that's not the case, the directors better start talking and start talking now. Every step along the way it seems this board had the opportunity to say no to the partnerships, to the waiver of the ethics code, and each time they had an opportunity to take the right fork in the road, they took the wrong fork.\" \nThe Oct. 12, 1999, minutes show that outside director Herbert Winokur -- now a member of the board's special investigating committee -- recommended that the board approve Fastow's participation in the LJM2 partnership. \nMcGurn said, \"The first principle of an investigation is that the people who presumably might be held responsible at the end of the day can't investigate themselves.\" \nThe other two members of the special committee -- Powers and Raymond S. Troubh, a New York consultant -- had no involvement with the company when the formation of the off-balance-sheet entities took place, sources close to the company said. \nW. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the outside directors of the board, said Winokur has no conflict of interest in serving on that special committee, despite his role in approving the partnership deals. \"It was important for the special committee to render its report quickly and Mr. Winokur's participation provided continuity and speed to the special committee's efforts,\" Eggleston said. \nThe board minutes show that as early as Dec. 9, 1997, Enron's executive committee approved a buyout -- that included a corporate guarantee of $633 million -- of the interest of the California public employees pension fund in the JEDI partnership. \nAt an Aug. 7, 2000, meeting of the finance committee, chaired by Winokur, the off-balance-sheet partnerships are described as \"the vehicles the company was utilizing to manage its balance sheet debt.\" Directors Wendy Gramm and Lay were among other board members that also attended the meeting. \nAt a special board meeting on June 28, 1999, Lay called on Skilling to discuss a proposed investment partnership. \"Mr. Skilling noted that due to changes in the accounting treatment of off-balance-sheet transactions, the company had been analyzing new types of financing vehicles. He called on Mr. Fastow to discuss the proposal.\" \nSkilling resigned suddenly in August. Fastow was ousted in October. \nThe LJM partnerships were specifically cited by the company last fall when it admitted violating some accounting standards, resulting in a $586 million overstatement of its profits between 1997 and 2001. \nThe excerpts that became available yesterday give no hint that board members had questions or qualms about the accounting maneuvers, with the exception of Fastow's dual role as Enron's chief financial officer and LJM's manager. \nStaff writers David Hilzenrath, Albert B. Crenshaw and Carrie Johnson contributed to this report. Peter Behr reported from Houston.\n\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com \nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Lay has until Feb. 12 to respond. \nQuestions posed to Lay in a letter signed by Rep. W.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin, R-La., committee chairman, and other members seek details on how the memo was distributed and whether Ceconi's allegations were investigated. \n"}, "op_id": "24a4e4976d", "logical_op_id": "fde16923e7", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 0.00013303756713867188, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null, "image_operation": null, "op_details": {"outputSchema": "TextFile(contents, filename)", "dataset_id": "enron-eval"}}, {"record_id": "6996dd8155", "record_parent_id": null, "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/martin-t-inbox-96-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "martin-t-inbox-96-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <8664618.1075841171256.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 18 Jan 2002 14:32:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nTo: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nSubject: Enron Mentions -- 01/18/02\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SPALME2>\nX-To: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spalme2>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Martin, Thomas A.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: MARTIN-T\nX-FileName: tom martin 6-25-02.PST\n\n\nMore than one Enron official warned company about growing crisis\nSalon.com, 01/18/2002\n\nIf Enron isn't a political scandal, nothing is\nSalon.com, 01/18/2002\n\nUSA: Enron lawyer raised partnership concerns-Salon.com.\nReuters English News Service, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron CEO under fire again \nReport: Lay knew of accounting problems when he exercised options. \nCNN, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron Attorney Asks Judge to Approve Sale of Energy-Trading Operations\nDow Jones Business News, 01/18/2002\n\nBlackstone says Enron unit could earn 1-2 bln usd a year if UBS deal approved\nAFX News, 01/18/2002\n\nRuling on Enron sale expected Friday\nEnron fires Andersen as auditor \nCBS.MarketWatch.com, 01/18/2002\nCheney discussed Enron with Indian leader\nCNN, 01/18/2002\n\nUSA: UPDATE 2-Cheney spoke to Indian officials on Enron project.\nReuters English News Service, 01/18/2002\n\nCheney's Mention of Enron To Indian Politician Draws Attention\nCNN: Live Today, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron Fires Andersen As Auditor\nChannel 2 Houston, 01/18/2002\n\nUSA: Florida subpoenaes Enron papers in pension probe.\nReuters English News Service, 01/18/2002\n\nPOWER POINTS: Enron Energy Services Still In The Game\nDow Jones Energy Service, 01/18/2002\n\nPataki giving donation from wife of Enron chief to employees' fund\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nPetrobras Eyes Enron's Stake in TGS.\nBusiness News Americas, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron subsidiary in Bothell strapped for cash\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nUSA: UPDATE 1-Moody's may change the way it rates companies.\nReuters English News Service, 01/18/2002\n\nTHE SKEPTIC: Accountants Under The Microscope Post-Enron\nDow Jones International News, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron 'winners' outside Beltway\nNeither party can benefit\nMSNBC.com, 01/18/2002\n\nFlorida governor speaks at father's presidential museum\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nFormer Enron Lobbyist Racicot Elected Republican Chairman\nDow Jones Energy Service, 01/18/2002\n\nCarson returns Enron contribution\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nSen.

Another executive was reassigned after raising alarms.\nBy Jake Tapper, Salon.com\nJan. 18, 2002 | In recent weeks, Enron executives have insisted that their controversial -- and ultimately disastrous -- accounting strategies were legally vetted. But Salon has learned that a law firm hired secretly by one of Enron's own attorneys last year recommended that the huge energy trader stop setting up the financial instruments whose exposure later drove the company into bankruptcy. \nAt the heart of the Enron scandal are a series of complex partnerships that Enron employed to keep billions of dollars of debt off its books -- thus boosting both its quarterly profits and its credit level. Enron executives participated in these partnerships, earning millions of dollars in management fees and raising major conflict-of-interest issues. \nEmbattled Enron CEO Ken Lay has attempted to justify the partnerships by noting that Enron's own staff attorneys as well as those at Vinson & Elkins, its powerful outside law firm, signed off on them. Despite this legal advice, it was reported earlier this week that one Enron executive, Sherron S. Watkins, raised serious questions about the propriety of the partnerships in a memo sent to Lay in late August. Salon has now learned of two other major instances in which Enron executives were told by company colleagues that the partnerships were deeply troubling and possibly illegal. \nIn one case, an Enron staff attorney took the extraordinarily unusual step of secretly retaining another outside law firm to evaluate the legality of the partnerships set up by then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. \nLast summer, before Enron was forced to reveal the actual state of its finances, Fastow moved to set up more of these partnerships. But Fastow's plan was blocked when an Enron attorney named Jordan Mintz took matters into his own hands. According to sources inside Enron, Mintz, who had just moved from the company's tax department to its finance department, was so concerned about the questionable nature of the partnerships -- and apparently so worried that Enron's attorneys were too close to the business schemes to judge them correctly -- that he sought a second legal opinion. \n\nWithout the knowledge of his boss, Enron chief counsel James Derrick Jr., Mintz hired an outside firm far removed from Enron and its Houston-based firm, Vinson & Elkins, to take a fresh look at the questionable deals. After reviewing the partnerships, the respected New York firm hired by Mintz -- Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson -- recommended to him that Enron stop setting up the the shell partnerships. The New York firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to company executives urging Enron to halt the practice -- which they apparently did. In October, Enron fired Fastow. Last month, he hired celebrated attorney David Boies, who represented Vice President Al Gore during his Florida recount battles. \nContacted Wednesday night, Mintz declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege. When asked about the Mintz retention of outside counsel, Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said \"this is the first I've heard of that\" and declined to comment further. A spokesman for Fried Frank did not return a call for comment. \nWithout specifically confirming the Mintz episode, House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Ken Johnson said that worried Enron executives did go outside the company for legal advice: \"(This) happened in a couple instances. There was more than one person who was spooked by these partnerships.\" \nIt is unusual for a corporate lawyer to go behind the back of his boss, the chief counsel, and retain an outside firm to do work for a company. And it was against standard operating procedure at Enron, where chief counsel Derrick had to approve of any outside legal work. But Mintz apparently thought that Derrick, who had worked at Vinson & Elkins before joining Enron, was too much a part of the company's closed culture, in which dubious business practices had become the norm.\nNo less than 10 congressional committees are investigating the collapse of Enron, an energy trading company with close ties to politicians in general and the Bush administration in particular. On Wednesday the Senate Finance Committee joined the ranks of nine other House and Senate bodies -- as well as the Departments of Labor and Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service -- by announcing that it, too, would look into the largest bankruptcy in American history. \nOn Wednesday, investigators with the House Energy & Commerce Committee interviewed David Duncan, the former Enron auditor with Arthur Andersen who had been fired the day before. \nOne of the primary questions under investigation is why Fastow and other Enron executives were permitted to establish complex and secretive partnerships with odd, obscure names -- LJM1, LJM2, JEDI, Chewco, the Raptor entities, Osprey, Big Doe -- that allegedly reaped these partners windfall profits while hiding Enron debt. In November, Enron had to revise its finance statements for the past four and a half years, acknowledging that the company was $600 million in net income poorer than it had led the government and its investors to believe. The Houston company also had to acknowledge an additional $2.5 billion in debt -- much of which came from these murky \"partnerships.\" Recent revelations tied to the Watkins memo may result in billions more debt added to the Enron ledger. \n\"Someone should have stepped up and said, 'No, you can't do these sort of things!'\" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. But for too long no one did, the employee added. And then when someone finally spoke up, it was too late. \nCurrently, much is being made in the media of Watkins' August letter to CEO Kenneth Lay, released on Tuesday by investigators with the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals,\" Watkins wrote. \"The business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax.\" \nBut Watkins' letter, said one source, was not the only alarm being sounded within the company before it imploded. In addition to the flags raised by Watkins and Mintz, then-treasurer Jeff McMahon also aired his own growing concern. In her memo, Watkins alluded to McMahon's tribulation, writing that he \"was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of [the] LJM [partnership]. He complained mightily to [chief executive] Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later, Skilling offered him the CEO spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the five steps with him.\" \nIn the eyes of many Enron executives at the time, McMahon's new assignment was meant to silence him. McMahon \"learned about these partnerships and he thought they were wrong,\" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. \"He thought they were a huge conflict of interest.\" McMahon, according to this source, went to Skilling and said, \"'We have this problem, and I think there's a conflict.' Skilling says, 'I'll take a look at it; I'll take care of it.' And the next thing you know, he's reassigned. And it was not a promotion.\" To other executives it looked like retaliation against a whistleblower, an Enron source said. \nMcMahon \"did go to Jeff Skilling and tell him he was uncomfortable with the internal and external conflicts the LJM partnerships were creating,\" confirmed Enron spokesman Palmer. \"And he told him he could no longer serve as treasurer with those conflincts in place.\" As for whether the reassignment was a demotion of any sort, Palmer said, \"It's probably open to interpretation by a lot of people.\" \nIn August, the same month Watkins wrote her memo, Skilling himself resigned from Enron under mysterious circumstances. McMahon, who replaced Fastow as Enron's chief financial officer in October, did not return a call for comment. \n\"We hope in the very near future to be interviewing Mr. McMahon,\" House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Johnson said. \"We feel he has a lot to offer.\" Johnson's committee has uncovered a number of incriminating details in the Enron investigation, including the shredding of documents and the Watkins memo. \nA congressional source also reports that such matters may be just the tip of the iceberg, that much more damaging information will be coming out in the next few weeks dealing with the Enron partnerships. \n________\n\n\n \n\n \nIf Enron isn't a political scandal, nothing is\nSo what if Bush and company didn't bail out Enron? The outrage lies in what politicians did for the company on its way up, not the way down.\nBy Scott Rosenberg, Salon.com\nJan. 18, 2002 | The collapse of Enron, we now hear, is not a \"political scandal\" -- it's a \"business story.\" A fine distinction! So far, no one possesses evidence that government officials lied, goofed around with interns, ran guns from the White House basement, burglarized opponents' campaign offices or accepted bags of unmarked bills. And so a growing chorus in the media now chants that the Enron affair should not be considered in the same class as Whitewater, Watergate, Iran/Contra or any of the other previous brouhahas that have consumed Washington and brought presidencies to their knees. \nThis tells us that the scandal yardstick our political and media culture currently uses is bent like a pretzel. You say your president may have finagled a real estate deal many years ago? Time to name a special prosecutor! He lied about his sex life? Draw up the articles of impeachment! But tell us that a high-profile corporation donated millions of dollars to legions of politicians, including the president; bent the government to its will; lined the pockets of its executives while dodging all taxes; then went bankrupt, vaporizing thousands of employees' retirement accounts? Nah, that's no \"political scandal.\" Come on -- where're the bimbos? \nEnron's dismal story simply doesn't meet the high bar of triviality the press today demands. The sums of money involved are too great; the flaws in our political system that it exposes are too vast. It's just too real to qualify. \n\n\nUSA: Enron lawyer raised partnership concerns-Salon.com.\n\n01/18/2002\nReuters English News Service\n(C) Reuters Limited 2002.\n\nNEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - An Enron Corp. lawyer raised the alarm last summer at the energy trader about off-balance-sheet partnerships that helped drive it into bankruptcy, said Internet media company Salon.com on Friday. \nAccording to Salon.com, an Enron staff lawyer named Jordan Mintz, who was worried about the legality of the partnerships, last summer hired an outside law firm to review the complex partnerships without Enron's knowledge.\nThe law firm, Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, recommended to Mintz that Enron should stop setting up the shell partnerships, Salon.com said, citing Enron sources. \nThe New York law firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to Enron executives urging the company to halt the practice. Salon.com said Enron apparently followed the advice. \nMinz declined to comment when contacted late Wednesday, citing attorney-client privilege, and Fried Frank did not return a telephone call, Salon.com said. \nThe partnerships allowed Enron to keep debt off its books, gain higher credit ratings and help boost the company's profile among investors. Concerns about the murky partnerships led investors to dump Enron shares after the company reported its first quarterly loss in four years in October and later reduced its earnings over the same period by about $600 million. Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, the biggest in U.S. history.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nEnron CEO under fire again \nReport: Lay knew of accounting problems when he exercised options. \n\nNEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Documents say that Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay sold shares of the energy trader's stock after receiving a letter warning of an accounting problem, according to a published report Friday.\n\nThe Arthur Andersen internal memos, including a letter from employee Sherron Watkins mentioning a meeting with Lay, were released yesterday by Congress, according to the New York Times. Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, is also under investigation for its accounting methods in the case.\n\nSeparately, another report emerged late Thursday that Enron corporate lawyer, Jordan Mintz, hired law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson last summer to take another look at Enron's financial structure. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt worked at the law firm until last fall.\n\nFried Frank recommended that Enron end its partnership deals, Salon.com said.\n\nThe letter from Watkins, written Aug. 15, said she had scheduled a meeting with Lay on Aug. 20 to discuss the accounting issues. Lay exercised options on 93,620 shares for $2 million on Aug. 20 and Aug. 21, the report said.\n\nWhile Lay did not report selling the shares, worth $3.5 million at the time, Enron officials said earlier this week that some of the money went to repay a loan, according to the Times.\n\nCorporate stock sales must be disclosed by the tenth of the month in which the sale takes place, unless the shares are turned over to the company to repay a loan, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's collapse. The firm's bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2 was the largest in U.S. history.\n\nThousands of employees lost their pensions and life's savings in the former Wall Street darling's downfall, which began last autumn when the firm acknowledged several hundred million dollars of previously undisclosed liabilities.\n\nThe saga has also embroiled Andersen, whose reviews of Enron's finances have come under heavy fire amid the firm's admission that employees destroyed a large number of e-mails and documents related to an audit of the energy trader.  \n \n\nEnron Attorney Asks Judge to Approve Sale of Energy-Trading Operations\nBy Kathy Chu\n\n01/18/2002\nDow Jones Business News\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nDow Jones Newswires \nNEW YORK -- An Enron Corp. attorney implored a federal judge here to approve the sale of its energy-trading operations to UBS AG in order to bring a \"failed\" business \"back to life.\"\nMartin Bienenstock, of Weil Gotshal & Manges, which represents the bankrupt energy company, said the core operation -- which generated about 90% of Enron's (ENRNQ) $101 billion in revenue last year -- may lose its value if the deal isn't closed soon. \nIf the sale isn't approved, 600 traders and back-office staff could leave in the near future, taking their knowledge of the business with them, according to Steve Zelin, a senior managing partner in Blackstone Group's restructuring division. Blackstone serves as Enron's financial adviser in the deal. \nUnder the deal with UBS (UBS), Enron could get more than $2 billion in royalties and other payments, according to Mr. Zelin, assuming that the Swiss bank eventually exercises a buyout option of the bankrupt company's profit stake. \nUBS, which has agreed to pay Enron 33% of the trading business' pretax royalties for at least two years, may be able to satisfy part of its commitment by issuing debt to Enron. \nThe liquidation value of the trading operations is $40 million to $50 million, said Mr. Zelin. \nWrite to Kathy Chu at kathy.chu@dowjones.com \nCopyright (c) 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Andersen said the meeting was part of a routine review of risks and that no evidence of illegal actions or improper accounting was suspected during the meeting, or in a subsequent memo describing the discussions. \nEnron's formation of limited partnerships helped the company move high levels of debt off its books, improving the company's balance sheet. \nEarlier Thursday a federal judge overseeing all Enron lawsuits in Houston said she will hold a hearing Tuesday in connection with how and why Andersen destroyed Enron-related documents. \nJudge Melinda Harmon replaced Judge Lee Rosenthal this week. Rosenthal recused herself from the Enron cases with no explanation. She once was a partner at the law firm Baker & Botts, which is representing Dynegy, whose 2001 plan to merge with Enron was aborted. \nHarmon will hear Amalgamated Bank's request for expedited discovery and will consider a motion for a temporary restraining order prohibiting Andersen from destroying evidence. Andersen said it has ordered a halt to the destruction of any Enron-related documents. \nAndersen fired the man who served as its lead Enron auditor Tuesday.\nDavid Duncan, the fired Andersen partner, met Wednesday with staff and attorneys for the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He denied any wrongdoing. \nAlso on Thursday, House investigators requested that Andersen hand over additional notes or records from the 14 participants in a meeting five months ago into potential accounting landmines at Enron in a meeting five months ago. \nAmalgamated Bank is suing 29 Enron officers and directors along with Andersen for $25 billion in damages, alleging that the defendants sold more than $1 billion worth of shares while misrepresenting the financial state of the company. \nLisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com.\n\n\nCheney discussed Enron with Indian leader\n\nJanuary 18, 2002 Posted: 12:50 PM EST (1750 GMT)\n\nBy John King\nCNN Washington Bureau \n\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- Vice President Dick Cheney asked Indian opposition leader Sonia Gandhi last June about a multimillion-dollar debt owed to Enron from a major energy project in India, administration officials confirmed Friday. \nThe officials told CNN the subject came up for only a moment at a meeting at the White House, and that no one at Enron asked Cheney to raise the issue. Cheney met with Ghandi to discuss general diplomatic issues affecting the U.S. and India. \nThese two officials also noted that the taxpayer-financed Overseas Private Investment Corporation had a stake in the issue; OPIC could face payouts of perhaps $300 million, because it agreed to underwrite political risk insurance as part of the Enron deal. \nA Cheney aide said the vice president has had three meetings with Indian officials since the Bush administration took office. The $64 million Enron debt has come up just once, in the June 27th meeting with the opposition leader. \nThe aide told CNN that Enron CEO Kenneth Lay \"never asked him to do it, no one at Enron asked him to talk about it. It was in the briefing papers Cheney received in advance of the meeting, and he asked about the status of the Enron project.\" \nThe officials noted the meeting was in June; it was several months later that Enron's financial problems began to surface. \nAdministration officials say there was nothing improper about raising the Enron debt issue. But reports of Cheney's actions come at a time some Democrats in Congress are suggesting Enron benefited from its deep ties with senior Bush administration officials. \nThose Democrats are pressing for information on Enron-administration contacts and any administration actions that might have benefited Enron. \n"}, "op_id": "24a4e4976d", "logical_op_id": "fde16923e7", "op_name": "MarshalAndScanDataOp", "time_per_record": 0.0001270771026611328, "cost_per_record": 0.0, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": null, "answer": null, "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 0.0, "total_output_tokens": 0.0, "total_input_cost": 0.0, "total_output_cost": 0.0, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null, "image_operation": null, "op_details": {"outputSchema": "TextFile(contents, filename)", "dataset_id": "enron-eval"}}, {"record_id": "1077939f41", "record_parent_id": null, "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/martin-t-inbox-98-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "martin-t-inbox-98-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <28543449.1075841171541.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 18 Jan 2002 09:52:41 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nTo: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nSubject: Enron Mentions -- 01/18/02\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SPALME2>\nX-To: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spalme2>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Martin, Thomas A.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: MARTIN-T\nX-FileName: tom martin 6-25-02.PST\n\n\nEnron Letter Writer Worked At Key Partnership Early On\nDow Jones Energy Service, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron's Chief Sold Shares After Receiving Warning Letter\nThe New York Times, 01/18/2002\n\nA look at Thursday's developments involving Enron\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron fires Andersen=20\nBoard takes action as new facts surface=20\nHouston Chronicle, 01/18/2002\nIn Enron Leaders, Seeing the Worst Of Ourselves\nThe Washington Post, 01/18/2002\n\nBroadband-unit hype didn't match reality=20\nHouston Chronicle, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron chairman selling 2 homes, lot in Colorado for $16.2 million=20\nHouston Chronicle, 01/18/2002\n\nBlockbuster deal helped sow seeds of Enron fiasco CIBC World Markets agreed=\n to invest $115.2-million in affiliated partnership\nWall Street Journal,  01/18/2002\n\nDeals That Helped Doom Enron Began to Form in the Early 90's\nThe New York Times, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron deals that led to collapse began in early 1990s - report\nAFX News, 01/18/2002\n\nAndersen HQ 'discussed Enron purge'.\nFinancial Times, 01/18/2002\n\nAttorneys for Enron assure judge more documents won't be shredded\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nWhen Rules Keep Debt Off the Books --- Did Andersen Act Properly?

Skilling\n> resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its author was later\n> identified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for corporate\n> development at Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committee released\n> excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday:\n\n\n> Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't get\n> rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?\n> Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting\n> improprieties and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in its\n> accounting - most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor vehicle.\n> We do have valuation issues with our international assets and possibly\n> some of our EES MTM positions.\n> The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept that Skilling\nis\n> leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues can be fixed and\n> reported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002. How do we fix\n> the Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003, we will have\nto\n> pony up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed.\n> To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds flow\nof\n> $800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a vehicle\n> (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in later\nyears.\n> Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity issuance?\n> We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks via\nour\n> swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly - Avici\n> by 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power Company by\n> 80 percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the swaps won't\n> be there for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to offset these\n> losses. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the layman on the\nstreet\n> that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that\n> company with Enron stock in the future.\n> I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting\n> scandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on\nmy\n> r?sum?, the business world will consider the past successes as nothing\nbut\n> an elaborate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for \"personal\n> reasons\" but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down the road and\n> knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now than\n> resign in shame in two years.\n> Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I have\n> thought and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into one\n> big problem - we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and 2000, we\n> enjoyed wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold stock, we then\n> try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit like robbing the\n> bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later. Nice try, but\n> investors were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a share looking for $120\na\n> share and now they're at $38 or worse. We are under too much scrutiny and\n> there are probably one or two disgruntled \"redeployed\" employees who know\n> enough about the \"funny\" accounting to get us in trouble.\n> What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in the\n> all-employee meeting, but can you give some assurances that you and\nCausey\n> will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is going to\n> happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003?\n> Summary of Alleged Issues:\n>\n> RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at risk;\n> however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM.\n> If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is no\n> commitment to contribute more equity.\n> The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form of\n> Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.\n> Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptor\n> entities locking in our values for various equity investments we hold.\n> As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the\n> equity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying\n> securities.\n> This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying\n> capitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing\n> for reserves against our MTM positions.\n> To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we \"enhanced\"\n> the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing more ENE shares.\n> My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must \"enhance\"\n> the vehicles by $250 million.\n> I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and a\nlot\n> of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting treatment.\n> None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed\n> in the bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's problems of\nWaste\n> Management (news/quote\n>\n</redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custo\n> m/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=WMI>) - where AA paid $130 million\n> plus in litigation re questionable accounting practices.)\n> The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain the\n> \"accounting treatment\" to a man in the street, would you influence his\n> investing decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on a thorough\n> understanding of the facts? If so, you best present it correctly and/or\n> change the accounting.\n> My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the\n> transactions. If adequately explained, the investor would know that the\n> \"entities\" described in our related party footnote are thinly\ncapitalized,\n> the equity holders have no skin in the game, and all the value in the\n> entities comes from the underlying value of the derivatives\n(unfortunately\n> in this case, a big loss) AND Enron stock and N/P. Looking at the stock\nwe\n> swapped, I also don't believe any other company would have entered into\n> the equity derivative transactions with us at the same prices or without\n> substantial premiums from Enron. In other words, the $500 million in\n> revenue in 2000 would have been much lower. How much lower?\n> Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well, then no\n> one would be the wiser. If Enron stock did well, the stock issuance to\n> these entities would decline and the transactions would be less\n> noticeable. All has gone against us. The stocks, most notably Hanover,\nthe\n> New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser degrees.\n> I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a\n> clear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the\n> transactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities\nlaw\n> and accounting. I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for himself\n> what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the estimated\n> damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one of two\n> courses of action:\n> 1. The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated damage\ntoo\n> great; therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly reverse, unwind,\n> write down these positions/transactions.\n> 2. The probability of discovery is too great, the estimated damages to\nthe\n> company too great; therefore, we must quantify, develop damage\ncontainment\n> plans and disclose.\n> I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly\nincreased\n> with Skilling's shocking departure. Too many people are looking for a\n> smoking gun.\n> Summary of Raptor Oddities:\n> 1. The accounting treatment looks questionable.\n> a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a\nrelated\n> party.\n> b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk except\n> Enron.\n> c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a\n> contribution of its own shares.\n> One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in its\n> equity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I can't\n> find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who will\nlose\n> this money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party entity?\n> If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact\npattern\n> that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors.\n> 2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms length.\n> a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party at\n> what now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici have\n> fallen away significantly since. The related party was unable to lay off\n> this risk. This fact pattern is once again very negative for Enron.\n> b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into\nthese\n> transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was the\n> compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such\n> transactions?\n> 3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees question\n> our accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This alone is cause\n> for concern.\n> a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM. He\n> complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought\n> should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later,\n> Skilling offered him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Markets and\nnever\n> addressed the five steps with him.\n> b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen\n> about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM.\n> c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal investments\n> group say, \"I know it would be devastating to all of us, but I wish we\n> would get caught. We're such a crooked company.\" The principal\ninvestments\n> group hedged a large number of their investments with Raptor. These\npeople\n> know and see a lot.

The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu.\nThe market dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the\nsession between $2.10 - $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as\nlocals sold down the contract to the $2.07 support level and went home\nshort. The AGA will release this week's storage report this afternoon, and\nwhile some traders are predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf\nwithdrawal, look for the number to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in\nthe Midwest and Texas, the growing differential between cash and futures,\nand the perceived premium in the early March contract have kept the market\nfrom dropping further. Physical prices retained their premium over futures\nyesterday on short-term cold weather at some pipelines, maintaining about\na $0.07 - $0.10 premium over the NYMEX. But cash traders expect the demand\nto ease quickly as temperatures moderate by this weekend. As usual, the\nmarket will look to the weekly storage report for short term direction,\nbut it is the massive amount of volumes still in storage compared to last\nyear that has put a cap on longer term price increases. Natural gas for\nnext day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to plus or\nminus a few cents yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the\nHenry hub gained $0.02 to $2.20 per MMBtu.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n Exploit the enterprise-wide transaction management power deployed by the\nbig names in gas.\nNUCLEUS Software\nZAINET Gasmaster\nThe most comprehensive, totally-integrated natural gas information system\navailable today.\nAsk about out limited-time offer competitive upgrade program.\nCAMINUS\nYour Competitive Edge in Energy.\nCall Caminus at (212)515-3700 or visit the website at\nhttp://www.caminus.com\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nToday's Power Bulletins\n * Ameren 4th Quarter Earnings Jump 19% as Increased Electricity Sales\nOffset Lower Prices\n * In Wake of Enron Collapse, Senate Energy Committee Takes 2nd Look at\nPublic Utility Holding Company Act at Hearing Today\n * California Senate Energy Committee's Plans Hearing on ISO's Market\nDesign Plan for 2002; Members Have Serious Doubts About ISO's Ability to\nEnforce Market Rules Going Forward\n * Allegheny Energy Files Shelf to Sell Up to $1.5 Billion in Common\nStock, Preferred Securities, Debt Securities, Warrants, Contracts, Units\nand Trusts\n * Unitil Cuts New Hampshire Electric Rates to Lowest in Region\n * El Paso Completes 172 MW Expansion of Linden NJ Power Plant\n * Centennial Power Acquires Rocky Mountain Power\n * Duke/Fluor Daniel to Build 875 MW Power Plant for South Carolina\nElectric & Gas\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nDO YOU JUST SEE TREES?

In\ntestimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that\nEnron had a $500 million loss in March. Rather than report it to\nshareholders, Enron gave a partnership called Raptor another $800 million\nin Enron shares. He said that there is no doubt that almost everyone, from\nthe board of directors on down, knew that the company was attempting to\noffset investment losses with stock. The partnerships allowed Enron to\nmisrepresent earnings for a period spanning the 3rd quarter of 2000\nthrough the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers told that committee\nthat over 70% of Enron's earnings for that period were false. He said that\nthere were red flags that should have alerted former chairman Ken Lay to\nwhat was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely understood that Enron\nwas using its own stock to offset the losses in the partnerships.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFAST.

This was a good price (average price LTM of 37p), but was below the quarter end price.  Therefore, there is a Q3 loss of $6.4 million.  Andrew Marsden is managing this in London.\nCompleted all requirements to sell COPEL shares (a $100+ million investment in the Brazilian utility).  Began selling shares on 7/17.  Current price is approximately $14 million below carrying value of approximately $120 million.  Likely to take a couple of months to exit entire position.  Investment is carried as \"Strategic\", and any losses upon the sale will fall \"below the line\" in the sale of non-merchant asset line.  Steven Sheldon is managing this.\nCompleted negotiations on the sale of Utiliquest for $62.5 million.  Should sign on Thursday.  Enron had invested $11.6 million in cash (net of JEDI II) and will receive $14.3 million.  The sale will net a cash gain to Enron, but below our carrying value of $16.3 million, yielding a $2 million accounting loss.  Kevin Kuykendall is managing this.\nFinalized processes to begin selling Hanover Compressor shares.  We own 4.6 million shares, which are trading at $30.00/share for a total value of $138 million.  Hanover has been hedged through Raptor.  However, the structure that was used to hedge is a costless collar that leaves Enron exposed below $34.875/share.  Therefore, at current trading levels we are facing a $23 million loss.  We are working with CSFB, which has proposed to execute a block trade sale.  However, the stock continues to decline each day, and CSFB will not make an offer until the price stabilizes.  If we have to sell at a block discount, or if the price continues to fall we could be facing a $35 million to $40 million loss.

Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, after Jeffrey K.\nSkilling resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its author\nwas later identified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for\ncorporate development at Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committee\nreleased excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday:\n\n   Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't\nget rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?\n   Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting\nimproprieties and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in\nits accounting -- most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor\nvehicle. We do have valuation issues with our international assets and\npossibly some of our EES MTM positions.\n\n   The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept that\nSkilling is leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues can\nbe fixed and reported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002.\nHow do we fix the Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003,\nwe will have to pony up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed.\n\n   To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds\nflow of $800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a\nvehicle (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in\nlater years. Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity\nissuance?\n\n   We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks\nvia our swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly\n-- Avici by 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power\nCompany by 80 percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the\nswaps won't be there for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to\noffset these losses. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the\nlayman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company and\nwill compensate that company with Enron stock in the future.\n\n   I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting\nscandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on\nmy resume, the business world will consider the past successes as\nnothing but an elaborate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for\n''personal reasons'' but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down\nthe road and knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship\nnow than resign in shame in two years.\n\n   Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I\nhave thought and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into\none big problem -- we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and\n2000, we enjoyed wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold\nstock, we then try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit\nlike robbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years\nlater. Nice try, but investors were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a\nshare looking for $120 a share and now they're at $38 or worse. We are\nunder too much scrutiny and there are probably one or two disgruntled\n''redeployed'' employees who know enough about the ''funny'' accounting\nto get us in trouble.\n\n   What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in the\nall-employee meeting, but can you give some assurances that you and\nCausey will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is\ngoing to happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003?\n\n   Summary of Alleged Issues:\n\n   RAPTOR  Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at\nrisk; however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid\nto LJM. If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is\nno commitment to contribute more equity.\n\n   The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some\nform of Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.\n\n   Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the\nRaptor entities locking in our values for various equity investments we\nhold.\n\n   As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the\nequity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying\nsecurities.\n\n   This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying\ncapitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing\nfor reserves against our MTM positions.\n\n   To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we\n''enhanced'' the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing\nmore ENE shares.\n\n   My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must\n''enhance'' the vehicles by $250 million.\n\n   I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and\na lot of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting\ntreatment. None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are\never disclosed in the bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's\nproblems of Waste Management -- where AA paid $130 million plus in\nlitigation re questionable accounting practices.)\n\n   The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain\nthe ''accounting treatment'' to a man in the street, would you influence\nhis investing decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on a\nthorough understanding of the facts? If so, you best present it\ncorrectly and/or change the accounting.\n\n   My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the\ntransactions. If adequately explained, the investor would know that the\n''entities'' described in our related party footnote are thinly\ncapitalized, the equity holders have no skin in the game, and all the\nvalue in the entities comes from the underlying value of the derivatives\n(unfortunately in this case, a big loss) AND Enron stock and N/P.\nLooking at the stock we swapped, I also don't believe any other company\nwould have entered into the equity derivative transactions with us at\nthe same prices or without substantial premiums from Enron. In other\nwords, the $500 million in revenue in 2000 would have been much lower.\nHow much lower?\n\n   Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well, then\nno one would be the wiser. If Enron stock did well, the stock issuance\nto these entities would decline and the transactions would be less\nnoticeable. All has gone against us. The stocks, most notably Hanover,\nthe New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser\ndegrees.\n\n   I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a\nclear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the\ntransactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities\nlaw and accounting. I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for\nhimself what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the\nestimated damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one\nof two courses of action:\n\n   1. The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated\ndamage too great; therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly\nreverse, unwind, write down these positions/transactions.\n\n   2. The probability of discovery is too great, the estimated damages\nto the company too great; therefore, we must quantify, develop damage\ncontainment plans and disclose.\n\n   I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly\nincreased with Skilling's shocking departure. Too many people are\nlooking for a smoking gun.\n\n   Summary of Raptor Oddities:\n\n   1. The accounting treatment looks questionable.\n\n   a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a\nrelated party.\n\n   b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk\nexcept Enron.\n\n   c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a\ncontribution of its own shares.\n\n   One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in\nits equity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I\ncan't find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who\nwill lose this money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party\nentity?\n\n   If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact\npattern that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors.\n\n   2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms\nlength.\n\n   a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party\nat what now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici\nhave fallen away significantly since. The related party was unable to\nlay off this risk. This fact pattern is once again very negative for\nEnron.\n\n   b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into\nthese transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was\nthe compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such\ntransactions?\n\n   3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees\nquestion our accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This\nalone is cause for concern.\n\n   a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM.\nHe complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he\nthought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days\nlater, Skilling offered him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Markets\nand never addressed the five steps with him.\n\n   b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would\nlisten about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM.\n\n   c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal\ninvestments group say, ''I know it would be devastating to all of us,\nbut I wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company.'' The\nprincipal investments group hedged a large number of their investments\nwith Raptor. These people know and see a lot. Many similar comments are\nmade when you ask about these deals. Employees quote our C.F.O. as\nsaying that he has a handshake deal with Skilling that LJM will never\nlose money.\n\n   4. Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the\nmoney trail between Enron and LJM/Raptor and its principals? Can he look\nat LJM? At Raptor? If the C.F.O. says no, isn't that a problem?\n\n   Condor and Raptor Work:\n\n   1. Postpone decision on filling office of the chair, if the current\ndecision includes C.F.O. and/or C.A.O.\n\n   2. Involve Jim Derrick and Rex Rogers to hire a law firm to\ninvestigate the Condor and Raptor transactions to give Enron\nattorney-client privilege on the work product. (Can't use V & E due to\nconflict -- they provided some true sale opinions on some of the deals).\n\n   3. Law firm to hire one of the big 6, but not Arthur Andersen or\nPricewaterhouseCoopers due to their conflicts of interest: AA & Co.\n(Enron); PWC (LJM).\n\n   4. Investigate the transactions, our accounting treatment and our\nfuture commitments to these vehicles in the form of stock, NP, etc., For\ninstance: In the third quarter we have a $250 million problem with\nRaptor 3 (NPW) if we don't ''enhance'' the capital structure of Raptor 3\nto commit more ENE shares. By the way: in Q. 1 we enhanced the Raptor 3\n", "sender": "dan.dorland@enron.com", "subject": "FW: Text of Letter to Enron's Chairman After Departure of Chief Executive"}, "op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "logical_op_id": "a431944fa4", "op_name": "LLMConvertBonded", "time_per_record": 1.638791799545288, "cost_per_record": 0.008685000000000002, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"sender": "dan.dorland@enron.com", "subject": "FW: Text of Letter to Enron's Chairman After Departure of Chief Executive"}, "input_fields": ["contents", "filename"], "generated_fields": ["sender", "subject"], "total_input_tokens": 3310.0, "total_output_tokens": 41.0, "total_input_cost": 0.008275000000000001, "total_output_cost": 0.00041000000000000005, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 1.6311421394348145, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": false, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "prompt_strategy": "PromptStrategy.DSPY_COT_QA", "image_conversion": "False", "inputSchema": "TextFile(contents, filename)", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "cardinality": "one-to-one", "udf": "None"}}, {"record_id": "2970a59bfb", "record_parent_id": "1f45999cb5", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/kaminski-v-deleted-items-1902.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "kaminski-v-deleted-items-1902.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <19381926.1075862452297.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 26 Nov 2001 17:36:38 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: vkaminski@aol.com\nTo: vkamins@enron.com\nSubject: Fwd: FYI\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: VKaminski@aol.com@ENRON\nX-To: vkamins@enron.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\VKAMINS (Non-Privileged)\\Kaminski, Vince J\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Kaminski-V\nX-FileName: VKAMINS (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\n\nReturn-Path: <J_Martin@baylor.edu>\nReceived: from  rly-yb03.mx.aol.com (rly-yb03.mail.aol.com [172.18.146.3]) by air-yb02.mail.aol.com (v82.22) with ESMTP id MAILINYB27-1126123929; Mon, 26 Nov 2001 12:39:29 -0500\nReceived: from  FS-EXCHANGE1.baylor.edu (mopsy.baylor.edu [129.62.3.249]) by rly-yb03.mx.aol.com (v82.22) with ESMTP id MAILRELAYINYB36-1126123856; Mon, 26 Nov 2001 12:38:56 -0500\ncontent-class: urn:content-classes:message\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative;\tboundary=\"----_=_NextPart_001_01C176A1.18D3DF49\"\nSubject: FYI\nX-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft Exchange V6.0.4712.0\nDate: Mon, 26 Nov 2001 11:38:02 -0600\nMessage-ID: <5E74244E8258EE45A18E795A5B0B8CB484B1B8@FS-EXCHANGE1.baylor.edu>\nX-MS-Has-Attach:\nX-MS-TNEF-Correlator:\nThread-Topic: \"Oh, the Games Enron Played\" (from the Knowledge@Wharton website)...\nThread-Index: AcF2menu5I9zmzM5Rq6Sf8X9AngbPwABxYnQ\nFrom: \"Martin, John D.\" <J_Martin@baylor.edu>\nTo: \"David Martin (E-mail)\" <dmartin@imperialcapital.com>,        \"Vince Kaminski (E-mail)\" <vkaminski@aol.com>\nX-Mailer: Unknown (No Version)\n\n\n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Garven, James R.  \nSent: Monday, November 26, 2001 10:47 AM\nTo: Martin, John  D.\nSubject: FYI: \"Oh, the Games Enron Played\" (from the  Knowledge@Wharton website)...\nOh, the Games Enron Played \nIn the 1990s, Houston's Enron Corp. was Wall Street's darling. It had  thrown out the energy-industry playbook, remaking itself from a staid gas  pipeline company to a high-tech trading firm that created exotic securities for  betting on everything from gas prices to the number of hot days in  summer.\nShare prices soared from $30 to $90 between 1998 and 2000, as  sales increased from $31 billion to more than $100 billion. Enron executives  gained reputations as the energy industry's visionaries.\nThis fall it all  came apart. Share prices have fallen by 90% this year, including a plunge from  just below $40 to less than $10 this fall. In October, Enron reported a  third-quarter loss of $618 million. The company's massive debt was downgraded to  near junk-bond status, and the CEO and CFO were expelled. Shareholders sued and  the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an  investigation.\nFinally, the humiliated company, which employs more than  20,000, agreed Nov. 9 to be taken over by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc.  for about $9 billion in stock and $13 billion in assumed debt. It is not certain  the merger will take place since it is subject to regulatory approval and could  be blocked on antitrust grounds. And some news accounts suggest that major  Dynegy shareholders could derail the merger over concerns about inheriting  liabilities from current or future lawsuits by Enron shareholders.\nThe  Enron story is not simply a case of a lone company that played with fire and got  burned. Enron was able to take enormous risks while keeping shareholders in the  dark because it could exploit accounting loopholes for subsidiaries that are  available to most publicly traded companies. Companies like Enron can legally  conceal massive debts because rules require a full accounting of a subsidiary's  balance sheet only when the parent company owns more than half of it.\n\"If  I'm a shareholder of Enron and I want full and fair disclosure, I would want  information about the entities Enron controls,\" says Wharton accounting  professor Robert E. Verrecchia. Yet Enron shareholders have never received such  a report.\nEnron's fate is crucial to the energy industry and other  markets it serves, points out Paul R. Kleindorfer, a professor of public policy  and an expert on deregulation at Wharton. Producers and users of gas, oil,  electricity and other forms of energy rely on Enron's system for trading  futures, forwards, options, swaps and other contracts to get the best prices and  control costs far into the future. Without such a system, deregulation simply  cannot work.\n\"If Enron's trading platform were to go down it would not be  a minor loss,\" Kleindorfer says. \"It would be a huge loss for the industry?.In  the early 1990s the company single-handedly produced the backbone infrastructure  that has led to a whole industry of broker intermediation.\"\nTo some  extent, Enron appears to have been a victim of sagging securities prices and  volatile energy costs in 2000 and 2001, and it has lost hundreds of millions by  laying fiber-optic cable for which there is no demand. But although those  factors may have determined the timing of the company's troubles, they were not  the chief cause. Enron appears to have lost enormous amounts of shareholder  money by gambling at its own roulette wheels.\n\"In hindsight, we made some  very bad investments in non-core businesses that performed worse than we ever  could have conceived,\" Chairman Kenneth Lay told analysts last week.\nHow  did Enron get into this mess?\nBecoming a Market Maker\nWhen  it was created in 1985 by the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth,  parent company of Northern Natural Gas, Enron's chief business was the operation  of thousands of miles of natural gas pipeline. Lay became chairman in Feb. 1986.  Then early in the 1990s, the federal government took key steps to deregulate the  energy industry.\nPreviously, large regulated utilities were vertically  integrated, giving them control from wellhead to consumer, Kleindorfer says.  Deregulation effectively broke apart the production, long-range transmission and  local distribution functions, leaving each to a different set of players. A  factory owner, for example, can now buy gas or electricity from number of  producers.\nTo function, a free market such as this needs brokers, or  intermediaries, to create, buy and sell contracts for production and delivery,  and it requires a market maker to facilitate trading, just as the big Wall  Street firms and exchanges facilitate trading in stocks. Enron created that  marketplace. \"This intermediation activity, or brokerage activity, just  revolutionized the marketplace,\" Kleindorfer says.\nSince utilities and  other energy users must line up dependable supplies for many months in the  future, they rely on various forms of contracts specifying quantities, prices  and delivery dates. But before the commodity is delivered, prevailing prices may  go up or down, and a supplier may find it has promised to sell at a price that's  now too low, while a purchaser may find that it could have bought for less than  it had agreed to pay.\nSuppliers and purchasers therefore use a variety of  derivative contracts to benefit from prices that move in their favor and hedge  in case prices move against them. A company that has contracted to buy a  shipload of liquefied natural gas at a specific price in three months, could,  for a much smaller sum, buy an options contract giving it the right, but not the  obligation, to buy a shipload at a lower price. And it could buy an option  giving it the right to sell at a higher price. Thus it is protected regardless  of whether prices move up or down.\nThis was the business Enron invented.  By permitting competition and price discovery far into the future, it brought to  the marketplace the most efficient pricing and allowed energy users to predict  and stabilize costs far into the future, Kleindorfer says. \"Having that  information historically, as well as projected into the future, could  revolutionize how you plan your business,\" he said. \nAt the heart of  Enron's business strategy was the belief that it could be a big energy player  without owning all the power plants, ships, pipelines and other facilities  involved. Instead, it could use contracts to control the facilities in which  other companies had invested, says Ehud Ronn, director of the Center for Energy  Finance Education and Research at the Red McCombs School of Business at the  University of Texas at Austin. The Center trains masters candidates in the use  of energy securities. (Enron is one of the center's eight corporate  sponsors.)\nEnron, he says, evolved into something akin to a Wall Street  firm. \"Enron thought of itself in very similar terms as an investment banker  that wanted to tie up as little capital as possible.\"\nBy 2001, Enron had  evolved into a market maker for some 1,800 different products, many of them  energy- or Internet-related contracts or derivatives the company had created  itself. They included products allowing customers to buy, sell, hedge or  speculate in markets ranging from traditional commodities like coal, oil, gas  and electricity to cutting edge markets for Internet bandwidth, pollution  emissions, semiconductors, wind energy and many others. Prices for many of these  products were available on the company's free website, giving the energy markets  unprecedented price transparency.\nBetting on the Weather\nTo  see how these products could be used, consider one of Enron's \"weather risk  management\" products meant for utilities, energy distributors, agricultural  companies and financial institutions. A gas utility, for example, might use a  \"floor\" to protect its revenue in the event of a mild winter. In exchange for a  premium similar to that paid on an insurance policy, Enron will compensate the  utility for every day between November and March on which the temperature rises  above a set level. The payments would make up for reduced gas sales.\nIn  another form of contract called a swap, or collar, Enron will pay the gas  company a given amount if the number of warm days exceeds a set level. But if  the number of cold days exceeds a threshold, the gas company will make a  payment to Enron. The utility would not have to pay a premium as it would with  the floor, and if it had to pay Enron, the money would come from the extra  revenue received by selling more gas in a colder-than normal winter.\nTo a  layman this might look like betting. \"We never use that word,\" says Ronn. \"The  worst we say is to 'have a view.'\"\nIn practice, other parties are often  involved in such transactions, taking over the contractual obligation created by  Enron. So, in addition to placing its own bets, Enron serves as a middleman, the  way a stockbroker stands in the middle of a securities trade.\nLike many  middlemen, Enron has to be in a position to make good on any transaction should  either party default. Otherwise, it would be hard to make a market in these  products. In addition, says Ronn, Enron often has to pay out money before  receiving payment from another party. Finally, Enron needed large amounts of  capital to trade products in its own account, just as a Wall Street firm invests  in stocks on its own in addition to executing customers' trades. To accomplish  all this, Enron needed vast amounts of capital. \"You do need to have liquidity  in huge numbers,\" Ronn says.\nThis created a dilemma. A public company can  raise capital by selling additional shares, but current shareholders don't like  that because the new shares dilute the value of their holdings. The alternative  is to borrow, but large debts hurt a company's credit rating, forcing it to pay  higher interest rates on its loans.\nAndrew S. Fastow, who became the  company's senior vice president of finance in 1990, found innovative ways to  issue new shares without dilution and to raise capital by selling old-fashioned  assets like power plants and pipelines.\n\"He has invented a groundbreaking  strategy,\" Ted. A. Izatt, senior vice president at Lehman Brother's Inc., told  CFO Magazine in the fall of 1999. Or, as Enron president and CEO Jeffrey  K. Skilling told the magazine: \"We needed someone to rethink the entire  financing structure at Enron from soup to nuts. We didn't want someone stuck in  the past, since the industry of yesterday is no longer. Andy has the  intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways. He deserves every  accolade tossed his way.\"\nFastow, named chief financial officer in March  1998, told the magazine: \"We transformed finance into a merchant  organization?.Essentially, we would buy and sell risk positions.\" A key to the  strategy: Move many of Enron's transactions \"off the balance sheet.\" In part,  this involved exploiting a loophole in the securities and accounting  regulations. As noted earlier, debts accumulated by subsidiaries, partnerships  or other \"entities\" can be kept off the parent company's books so long as the  parent does not own more than 50% of the entity incurring the debt.\nBy  using so-called unconsolidated subsidiaries, \"you do not make transparent either  the nature of the investment or the relationship between the parent and the  subsidiary,\" said Verrecchia. Heavy hitters such as Wall Street analysts and  major shareholders may have the clout to get a company to provide additional  information on subsidiaries. \"But if you're just an investor picking up Enron's  annual report, you are stuck,\" Verrecchia added.\nA Pattern of Sketchy  Details \nIt has long been clear from company statements and SEC  filings that Enron's off-balance-sheet transactions were enormous, but details  were sketchy because Enron did not have to report them, and chose not to. By  this fall, however, it became obvious these transactions involved huge risks  when Enron acknowledged it had improperly kept some activity off its books.  Putting those debts and losses into Enron's financial statements last month  meant reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. Corrected statements reduced  net income by $96 million for 1997, $113 million for 1998, $250 million for 1999  and $132 million for 2000.\nAt issue were so-called \"special purpose  entities,\" or SPEs, set up for a variety of transactions for Enron's benefit.  Enron conceded some of these entities did not meet the accounting standards to  be kept off of Enron's books. In one case, for instance, the entity had  \"inadequate capitalization\" for such treatment.\nIn 2000, Enron had  created four entities known as Raptor I, II, III and IV to \"hedge market risk in  certain of its investments,\" according to an Enron filing with the SEC. Enron  acquired notes receivable from the Raptors in exchange for an obligation to  issue Enron shares to the entities. But Enron had improperly included the value  of the notes receivable on its books without accounting for the cost of the  shares it would have to issue. In correcting this violation of accounting rules,  Enron said it had overstated its shareholders equity by $1 billion in March and  June 2001.\nEnron was particularly embarrassed in acknowledging that two  special purpose entities, limited partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM Co-Investment,  had Fastow as the managing partner. Fastow, who according to Enron made in  excess of $30 million in this role, was forced out of the company in October. An  internal committee and the SEC are investigating the use of the  partnerships.\nObviously, Fastow's role was a problem. If the partnerships  were truly independent entities, he was in a conflict of interest. If he was  running them on Enron's behalf, they were not independent.\nDespite the  write-downs and disclosures this fall, many analysts complain they still do not  have a full picture of Enron's activities. Enron, for instance, has not fully  described other partnerships it believes it can properly keep off the balance  sheet. Nor is it clear to what extent Enron's losses are due to bad bets it had  made through highly-leveraged derivatives. While a stock market investor can  simply hang on to shares to wait out a downturn, options and other derivatives  typically have expiration dates. If the bet has not turned out as hoped, the  entire investment can be lost.\n\"New disclosure was modest and management  did not resolve concerns,\" Goldman Sachs analysts David Maccarrone and David  Fleischer wrote in an Oct. 24 report to clients. Though Enron had long faced  such criticisms, investors had tended to give the company the benefit of the  doubt \"because of its strong growth in earnings and acknowledged industry  leading capabilities?,\" the two analysts said.\nIn other words, when stock  was soaring, investors didn't require details on how it was done. Now they are  crying foul, and a number of shareholder suits have been filed. Essentially,  they claim the company inflated its stock price by filing false financial  statements. Investors who bought shares at those high prices have suffered huge  losses.\nFor years, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets  accounting rules, has had a draft proposal for improving disclosure of  subsidiaries' activities and numbers. Essentially, it would move toward a more  qualitative evaluation of whether the parent controlled the subsidiary even if  it owned less than 50% of the stock. Control could be exerted by holding board  seats or through contracts that effectively make the subsidiary a unit of the  parent.\n\"What the FASB has promulgated seems to me to be sensible,\"  Verrecchia said, noting that the whole purpose of accounting is to give an  accurate view of a company's inner workings and true earnings. To conceal  obligations, risk and debt, as Enron and others do, undermines that goal, he  said.\nBut, facing heavy opposition from accountants and corporations, the  FASB has not acted on the draft proposal, citing insufficient support on its  board.

Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith in Los Angeles and Robin Sidel and Jonathan Weil in New York\n\n11/09/2001\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA3\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nEnron Corp. reduced its previously reported net income dating back to 1997 by $586 million, or 20%, mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings with partnerships run by some company officers. \nThe disclosure, contained in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, came even as the Houston energy-trading company continued its merger talks with rival Dynegy Inc. Dynegy, an independent power producer and utility owner, is looking at acquiring Enron for roughly $7 billion to $8 billion, people familiar with the talks say. However, those talks could also be influenced by whether Enron is further downgraded by major credit-ratings agencies.\nThe total price being discussed would equate to about $10 an Enron share, barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Enron shares were down 7.1%, or 64 cents, to $8.41, a tenth of their 52-week high of $84.875. \nOn the Big Board, Dynegy traded at $36.50, up $3.50. Shares of several energy-trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the California state government pay an estimated $1.6 billion for past power purchases. \nIn yesterday's SEC filing, Enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets, debt and shareholder equity back to 1997. For instance, for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, Enron lopped about $2.2 billion, or 19%, off shareholder equity, reducing it to a total of $9.5 billion. Previously, the company had disclosed a reduction of only $1.2 billion. \nThe filing also said that Enron discharged Ben Glisan, the company treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of Enron's North America unit, in connection with investments they made in one of the officer-run limited partnerships. Until yesterday, Enron had insisted that Mr. Glisan wasn't associated with the officer-run partnerships. The company wouldn't explain why the the two had been discharged, and Mr. Glisan and Ms. Mordaunt couldn't be reached to comment. \nThe SEC filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation's biggest energy-trading company during the past month. During that time, Enron has reported a big third-quarter loss, the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships, and an SEC investigation. \nThe SEC filing raises further questions about Enron's accounting procedures and disclosure policies. Concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts, including those at major credit-rating agencies. The agencies downgraded Enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for further downgrades. \nRalph Pellecchia, credit analyst for Fitch, said he couldn't predict what effect the SEC filing would have on Enron's credit rating, but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures. \"It's bad,\" he said. \nThe Enron SEC filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, which reviewed the company's annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals. Because of all the accounting adjustments \"the audit reports covering the year-end financial statements for 1997-2000 should not be relied upon,\" yesterday's SEC filing said. \nAn Andersen spokesman called Enron's restatement announcement \"an unfortunate situation\" but said the accounting firm is \"cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters.\" He said he couldn't comment further because of client-confidentiality concerns. \nAmong the accounting turnabouts, Enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to Michael \nKopper, a former managing director of the company's North America unit. The two partnerships were known as Joint Energy Development Investments LP, or JEDI, and Chewco Investments LP. \nAs reported, Mr. Kopper managed the general partner of Chewco, which was formed in 1997. JEDI had been formed in 1993 by Enron in partnership with the huge California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers. \nIn 1997 Enron, which operated JEDI, bought out Calpers' interest for $383 million and immediately sold it to Chewco, according to the SEC filing. Almost all the money for Chewco's purchase came in loans from JEDI and an unnamed financial institution, whose loan was guaranteed by Enron. \nBy having a supposed outside party in the form of Chewco as a partner, Enron treated JEDI as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet. Enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both JEDI and Chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997. Taking that step retroactively resulted in a $396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000, the SEC filing said. \nMr. Kopper, who left Enron in July to run the partnerships, didn't return a phone call seeking comment. In the past, he has declined to be interviewed. \nEnron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called LJM Cayman LP. That consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $103 million. \nLJM and a similar but much larger partnership, called LJM2 Co-Investment LP, were formed in 1999 by Enron's then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was replaced last month. The two partnerships were run by Mr. Fastow and Mr. Kopper, according to the Enron SEC filing and private partnership documents. Enron's SEC filing said the company believes that Mr. Fastow sold his interests in the LJM partnerships in July to Mr. Kopper. Mr. Fastow has declined to be interviewed. \nSeveral analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger LJM2 partnership. Some also pointed to a sentence in the SEC filing that said \"it is possible\" that continuing Enron reviews will \"identify additional or different information concerning these matters.\" \nAs such, \"there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the closet,\" said Brian Youngberg, energy analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. \nThe Enron SEC filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the LJM partnerships. Since 1999, those transactions produced $577.8 million in pretax earnings, despite a $711 million pretax charge in this year's third quarter due to the termination of deals with several LJM2-related entities. The filing also estimated that Mr. Fastow received more than $30 million from the LJM partnerships. \n--- Mea Culpa\n\nIn the midst of talks to be acquired by Dynegy, Enron details\naccounting and other actions.\n\n-- Will restate its financial results from 1997 through the third\nquarter of 2001, reducing previously reported income by $586 million\nand boosting previously reported debt to $628 million at the end of\n2000\n\n-- Concedes three entities run by company officials should have been\nincluded in its consolidated financial statements, based on generally\naccepted accounting principles\n\n-- Fires Ben Glisan, managing director and treasurer, and Kristina\nMordaunt, managing director and general counsel of an Enron division\n\n-- Establishes a special committee to review all transactions\n\nSource: the company\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It Doesn't Act Like It\nBy FLOYD NORRIS\n\n11/09/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 1, Column 2\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\n\nYOU'D be better informed if, instead of listening to what we say, you watch what we do.'' \nThat excellent advice was not issued by Enron management, although it should have been. Instead it came more than 30 years ago from John N. Mitchell, President Richard M. Nixon's attorney general.\nEnron's restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company's many strange transactions with related parties. It is now consolidating the results of some of its off-balance-sheet creations, though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery. \nBut the restatement should, at the least, cause investors and Wall Street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so-called pro forma earnings, which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules. \nIn January, Enron told investors its ''recurring net income,'' as it calls its pro forma number, would be $1.70 to $1.75 a share this year. The company's share price rose to $82 when that forecast was made. \nRemarkably, Enron is still on course to hit that target. Yesterday's restatement raised its nine-month earnings figure by a penny, to $1.36. And yet Enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $10 a share, or less than six times its reported profits, which still appear to be growing. Why so little? \nThe answer may be that Enron's board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance. Enron's failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring. And Enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid. So it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago. Don't call it a takeover. Takeunder would be a better term. \nWhat set off Enron's collapse? It now appears to have been a mistake. Enron says it added $1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error. The mistake did nothing to improve Enron's profits at the time, so it seems unlikely it was deliberate. Had the mistake not been made, the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $200 million, not $1.2 billion. That reduction scared investors into believing that Enron's transactions with partnerships led by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, had been disastrous for the company. Now it appears they may not have been so bad. \nBut that fact is not very important now. Enron's new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the Fastow partnerships. Such profits may be legal under accounting rules, but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are. \nIn fact, the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that may be important to Enron. The body charged with dealing with new accounting issues got a rush question on Oct. 23 -- the day before Enron ousted Mr. Fastow -- about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical ''Big Energy Corporation'' where one subsidiary, a natural gas pipeline company, trades with another subsidiary, an energy trading entity. The question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one. That company may or may not be Enron. \nSuch games will not work anymore, at least for Enron. It needs to be acquired because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers.\n\nGraph shows Enron share prices since Oct. 15. \nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Each embodied a sharply different approach to making money, attracting investors and winning over regulators.\nEnron thrived on risk, hurling itself into projects and businesses largely untested by others, earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of its murky accounting. \nDynegy is the slower, more cautious company, the younger sibling that carefully gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher Enron. Dynegy's steady progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibillion-dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor. \nAs one senior energy industry executive said, ''Enron's trying to hit more triples and home runs, while Dynegy tries for singles and doubles.'' \nKenneth Lay, the Enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies -- and whose influential friends include President Bush -- is the one who points to the bleachers. Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, Charles L. Watson, is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts. He also started small, nurturing his energy trading and generating company -- which had $33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30 -- from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid-80's. \nWhen electricity markets around the United States were deregulated, the companies followed clearly divergent paths. Utilities no longer necessarily generated power, and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity. Enron and Dynegy traded and marketed energy. Yet Enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power, a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast. \nDynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy. It cashed in, too, on deregulation, but not as Enron had. It stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations, retail power marketing, a water business and a broadband venture, most of which have gone badly awry. \nMr. Watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced. ''We need a little bit everywhere,'' he said. ''Enron is a financial player, but Dynegy is more of a physical player.'' \nIf Enron's finances grew more confusing, Dynegy seemed to offer clarity. If Enron promised a lot, analysts said, Dynegy played up its accomplishments. Enron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly, while Dynegy kept things quiet and discreet. \n''Chuck Watson is a pretty straight-talking guy,'' said Christopher R. Ellinghaus, a Williams Capital Group analyst. \nBecause Enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill, some analysts said, it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creative accounting. While Dynegy avoided such a path, no one really expects Mr. Watson to gloat about his company's new, larger stature. Enron may have been less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine, and it is unclear who will take on that role now. \n''Dynegy had what could be called a second-mover advantage,'' said Andre Meade, head of Commerzbank Securities' United States utility research. ''It seemed to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in Houston, Enron, go into a market. And if it was successful, Dynegy then could go in with less money and make it work.''\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN\n\n11/09/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 1, Column 2\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\n\nThe Enron Corporation yesterday sliced more than half a billion dollars from its reported profits over the last five years, but its crosstown rival, Dynegy Inc., still appeared to be willing to acquire Enron, executives close to the merger talks said. \nWorries about how bond rating agencies would react to the merger delayed announcement of the deal, the executives said. But the failure to announce a deal -- as well as the profit restatement -- caused Enron's share price to fall. And volume in its core North American natural gas and electricity trading operation plunged 20 percent as other energy-trading companies, unnerved by Enron's financial distress, steered business elsewhere.\nThe boards of the two companies tentatively agreed late Wednesday night to a deal in which Dynegy would acquire Enron for about $8 billion in stock, or roughly $10 a share. \nThe deal would include an initial $1.5 billion cash infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, and later an additional infusion of $1 billion. \nThe sticking point to proceeding with the deal, according to the executives, is whether Enron's credit rating will be reduced to ''junk'' status by the major credit rating agencies in reaction to Enron's disclosures and its plan to be acquired by Dynegy. \nDynegy and Enron have provided pro forma statements of what a combined Dynegy-Enron would look like and asked Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service for an ''expedited review'' of the transaction. \nDynegy and ChevronTexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a bigger cash infusion to buoy Enron's credit rating -- now just two notches from falling below investment grade -- if the agencies look askance at the current deal. The companies are hoping for a response within the next day or two, the executives said. \nThe executives also said Dynegy was seeking further protections that would allow it to back out of the deal if new, adverse disclosures surfaced. \nShares of Dynegy rose sharply yesterday, although it was not clear whether buyers believed that the company -- one-quarter the size of Enron, in terms of revenues -- was getting a bargain or that Enron's latest disclosures would lead to the deal's being abandoned. Dynegy rose $3.50, or 10.6 percent, to $36.50, gaining back all of the ground lost on Wednesday after news of the deal leaked. Enron shares fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, to $8.41. Less than a year ago, Enron traded for more than $84 a share, and the company was valued at nearly $70 billion. \nIn a sweeping restatement of its profits, Enron said that its actual net income for the years 1997 to 2000 was $591 million less than it had reported on its financial statements. In a filing with the S.E.C., Enron also indicated that part of last year's reported profits came from transactions with partnerships controlled by Andrew S. Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was ousted Oct. 24. \nEnron said the transactions involving Mr. Fastow, which are part of the S.E.C. investigation, earned the former executive more than $30 million. The company also said it had fired its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions, who both had invested in one of the partnerships. \nAny deal would also face long and complex reviews by federal and state energy regulators, who would have to sort out a range of competitive issues in the still-young business of wholesale natural gas and electricity trading. Among the agencies involved would be the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. \nSome analysts expressed hope that Enron's financial straits would encourage regulators to clear any deal, to relieve government officials of the prospect of dealing with the potential collapse of the nation's dominant energy-trading company. Enron handles about a quarter of all power trading, and higher proportions in some important regional markets. \n''If not for the dire condition of Enron today, we are not certain an Enron-Dynegy merger would be possible due to antitrust concerns,'' said Christopher R. Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital. ''However, the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the F.T.C., and would probably be looked at with some relief by the F.E.R.C.'' \nIt was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal. ''If Dynegy and Enron were to get together, obviously the thing that would appeal to Dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities, and that in itself would provide greater market power, not less market power,'' said Raymond Plank, chairman of the Apache Corporation, one of the largest independent natural gas producers, based in Houston. \nMr. Plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal. ''The thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility, and as a result, once again is threatening North American gas producers.'' \nEnron's restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997, and reduced it for every year since. But the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $5 million. \nThe changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent -- companies called Jedi and Chewco, after characters in the ''Star Wars'' movies -- and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called LJM1. That partnership, and another called LJM2, were run by Mr. Fastow. \nThe remainder of the earnings reductions, totaling $92 million from 1997 through 2000, came from what Enron called ''prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications,'' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditors, but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial. Details of those charges were not disclosed, and Enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions. \n''This is an unfortunate situation,'' said David Tabolt, a spokesman for Arthur Andersen, which audited Enron's books in all the years in question. ''Issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on Enron's financial statements or our audit reports. We are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters.'' \nWhile the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the LJM1 subsidiary, they did not fold the entire LJM1 partnership or the LJM2 partnership into Enron's financials. It is not clear how those partnerships performed. Nor did they include some other related entities whose Enron-guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors. \nMr. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, could not be reached for comment, his lawyer said. \nEnron's downward cascade began after it reported third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16. Its share price rose 67 cents, to $33.84, that day, as the company said its ''recurring net income'' had met analyst expectations, even though write-offs led to a net loss. \nIn a conference call that day, Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the LJM partnerships. In the following days, that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement. \nBut Enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $200 million, with the remaining $1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year. \nEnron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the LJM partnerships and assure they were proper. ''Whether these controls were properly implemented'' is being investigated by the special board committee, the company said. That committee has retained William McLucas, a former director of enforcement for the S.E.C., as well as accountants from Deloitte & Touche. \nThe company had disclosed that Mr. Fastow was involved with the LJM partnerships, but it had not reported that any other Enron officials were involved. Yesterday it said that three officers of the company, as well as another employee, had invested in an LJM1 subsidiary in March 2000. The officers were Ben Glisen, the company's treasurer; Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of an Enron division; and Kathy Lynn, vice president of an Enron division. The company said Ms. Lynn no longer worked for Enron and that the company was ''terminating the employment'' of the other two. \nSome industry officials said yesterday that a deal with Dynegy was increasingly looking like a do-or-die prospect for Enron, as other energy-trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies. While Enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets, by far its most valuable franchise is its energy-trading business in North America, which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company. \nYesterday, volume in that business dropped 20 percent. An Enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the S.E.C. investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with Dynegy. \nEnron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in Houston, executives said.

I wasn't trying to be critical of anyone specifically, and I think Dick is doing an admirable job.  I will give him high marks at PRC.  However, one position that has lost a significant amount of value since we were free to sell it is Avici.  Do you think that at PRC, this \"loss\" of value, which does not show up in a P/L since it is hedged by Raptor, should be taken into account when we evaluate the person?  My point is only that each of these investments are \"positions\" that should be \"owned\" by someone, like a book.  Hickerson didn't get evaluated on Avici because it didn't show up in a P/L (even though he lost a lot of value).  What do we do with Garland?  Now it has lost a lot of value again.  If Dick could sell an asset for a 10% loss today, but doesn't, and we eventually lose 30% upon disposition, how do you evaluate the performance?\n\nAndy  \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLavorato, John  \nSent:\tTuesday, April 03, 2001 11:09 AM\nTo:\tFastow, Andrew S.\nCc:\tKitchen, Louise\nSubject:\t\n\nAndy\n\nWith respect to North America, Dick Lydecker is liquidating most of the raptor assets.

Emshwiller and Kathryn Kranhold\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\n\n01/16/2002\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA4\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nA now highly publicized August 2001 letter from an Enron Corp. executive ra=\nising serious questions about the company's business and accounting practic=\nes was actually one of the later shots fired in an internal struggle that h=\nad been going on inside the energy-trading company for a year or more.=20\nThe letter to Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay from S=\nherron Watkins, a company vice president, detailed what she saw as the huge=\n financial and public-relations risks facing the company. Extensive dealing=\ns with partnerships that had been set up and run by some of the company's o=\nwn executives could cause Enron to \"implode,\" she wrote. Widespread disclos=\nure of those partnerships in the media beginning in October played a key ro=\nle in a collapse in investor confidence that eventually forced Enron to see=\nk bankruptcy-law protection.\nMs. Watkins's attorney, Philip Hilder, declined to discuss details of the l=\netter. But he said his client likely would cooperate with some of the gover=\nnment investigations into the Enron collapse. \"She has a compelling story a=\nnd I expect she'll have an opportunity to tell that story,\" Mr. Hilder said=\n.=20\nBut the story behind Ms. Watkins's letter is much more than that. It involv=\nes a power struggle over the direction of Enron as it committed itself to t=\nhe extremely unusual and tangled partnership structures that eventually con=\ntributed to its undoing. People familiar with that struggle say the issues =\nranged from the ethics of Enron's actions to a battle for the job of chief =\nfinancial officer at the Houston-based energy-trading company. The partners=\nhips -- called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP -- were formed in 19=\n99 by then Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who also ran the entities=\n and owned part of them. From the beginning, Mr. Fastow, Mr. Lay and other =\ntop company officials said the LJM partnerships were designed to do busines=\ns deals with Enron and help the energy company manage its financial risk.=\n=20\nHowever, other Enron officials were extremely skeptical about the partnersh=\nips, say company insiders and others familiar with the matter. For one thin=\ng, they saw inherent conflicts of interest in having the company's chief fi=\nnancial officer standing to financially benefit from business deals done wi=\nth Enron by an outside partnership that he headed. Late last year, Enron es=\ntimated that Mr. Fastow made more than $30 million from the LJM partnership=\ns.=20\nOne of the chief critics was Jeffrey McMahon, who in March 2000 took his co=\nncerns about LJM to then Enron President Jeffrey Skilling. Mr. Skilling did=\nn't share those concerns and soon after the meeting Mr. McMahon left his jo=\nb as corporate treasurer for another executive post within Enron.=20\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling says Mr. McMahon merely voiced worry about w=\nhether his own compensation might be affected if he had to negotiate deals =\non the opposite side of the table from LJM. Mr. McMahon \"never raised any b=\nroader concerns,\" she said.=20\n", "sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions (Part I) -- 01/16/02"}, "op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "logical_op_id": "a431944fa4", "op_name": "LLMConvertBonded", "time_per_record": 3.1974689960479736, "cost_per_record": 0.007940000000000001, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions (Part I) -- 01/16/02"}, "input_fields": ["contents", "filename"], "generated_fields": ["sender", "subject"], "total_input_tokens": 3008.0, "total_output_tokens": 42.0, "total_input_cost": 0.007520000000000001, "total_output_cost": 0.00042, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 3.1901371479034424, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": false, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "prompt_strategy": "PromptStrategy.DSPY_COT_QA", "image_conversion": "False", "inputSchema": "TextFile(contents, filename)", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "cardinality": "one-to-one", "udf": "None"}}, {"record_id": "ecb4bcae41", "record_parent_id": "096b7549bd", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/martin-t-inbox-14-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "martin-t-inbox-14-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <2943840.1075841146795.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 6 Feb 2002 06:47:29 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nTo: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nSubject: Enron Mentions (major papers only) -- 02/06/02\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SPALME2>\nX-To: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spalme2>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Martin, Thomas A.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: MARTIN-T\nX-FileName: tom martin 6-25-02.PST\n\n\nQuestioning the Books: Enron Official Failed to Warn Participants Of 401(k)=\n Plan\nThe Wall Street Journal, 02/06/2002\n\nENRON EXECUTIVES SAY THEY DEBATED FREEZE ON PENSION\nThe New York Times, 02/06/2002\n\nRich Employee, Poor Employee; Senate Panel Looking at Pensions Shown Both S=\nides of the Enron Coin\nThe Washington Post, 02/06/2002\n\nExecs say they tried to protect workers' money=20\nHouston Chronicle, 02/06/2002\n\nEnron CEO Felt 'Betrayed,' Panel Told; Head of Internal Probe Testifies on =\nthe Hill\nThe Washington Post, 02/06/2002\n\nEnron Officials Sought Lawyer's Dismissal Over Negotiations With Outside Pa=\nrtnership\nThe Wall Street Journal, 02/06/2002\n\nThe Financial Wizard Tied to Enron's Fall\nThe New York Times, 02/06/2002\nEnron CEO Felt 'Betrayed,' Panel Told; Head of Internal Probe Testifies on =\nthe Hill\nThe Washington Post, 02/06/2002\n\n$270 Million Man Stays in the Background\nThe Washington Post, 02/06/2002\n\nEnron Execs Sold Stock as Losses Grew Probe: The $44-million sell-off came =\namid concern that problems at partnerships could become public.

Ms. Olson=\n said Ms. Watkins also sought out Jeffrey McMahon, currently Enron's chief =\noperating officer, who was then its treasurer, for guidance at the time.\nEnron's retirement plans, decimated by the collapse of the Houston energy c=\noncern, will come under further scrutiny in Congress this week. Today, Labo=\nr Secretary Elaine Chao testifies before the House Education and Workforce =\nCommittee about whether retirement-plan rules should change in the wake of =\nEnron's collapse; tomorrow the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor=\n and Pensions will hear from former Enron workers.=20\nIn yesterday's hearing, Ms. Olson said she didn't share Ms. Watkins's alleg=\nations with the other 401(k) plan trustees because she didn't feel it was h=\ner responsibility to repeat \"hearsay.\" In addition, she said, Ms. Watkins h=\nad come to her in confidence. After Ms. Watkins took her concerns to Mr. La=\ny and he ordered an investigation, \"I felt it was all in good hands,\" Ms. O=\nlson said.=20\nEli Gottesdiener, a Washington-based lawyer representing Enron workers, cou=\nntered those arguments. \"She had information that affected the lives of 10,=\n000 people and did nothing,\" he said, adding, \"It's so clear that she breac=\nhed her duty.\" He said Ms. Olson should have convened an emergency meeting =\nof the trustees to inform them of Ms. Watkins's allegations so that they co=\nuld launch their own investigation. The trustees immediately could have sto=\npped offering Enron stock as an investment option, and stopped using Enron =\nstock as a matching contribution in the retirement plan.=20\nMs. Olson testified that the plan trustees felt that they didn't have the a=\nbility to change the plan design without approval from the board of directo=\nrs.=20\nMs. Olson herself sold much of her own Enron holdings, most before she knew=\n of Ms. Watkins's concerns, but some afterward. Responding to sharp questio=\nning from lawmakers, including Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democra=\nt who heads the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Ms. Olson acknowledg=\ned she sold 83,000 Enron shares for $6.5 million, the bulk from December 20=\n00 to March 2001. She said she decided to sell the shares after having a fa=\nlling out with former Enron President Jeffrey Skilling over their different=\n management styles. Thinking about leaving the company, she said, she went =\nto a financial adviser who advised her to diversify her portfolio; at his s=\nuggestion, she said, she put the proceeds from selling her Enron shares int=\no government bonds.=20\nA few days before Enron filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, Ms=\n. Olson said she sold an additional 3,000 Enron shares that were in her emp=\nloyee stock ownership plan, for $2 each. She said she didn't have knowledge=\n of the bankruptcy, but suspected the possibility.=20\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Lieberman said he would issue subpoenas to gather m=\nore information about the alleged payment of $105 million in bonuses to man=\nagement around the time Enron filed for Chapter 11, and the company's alleg=\ned failure to pay workers severance pay, beyond a one-time $4,500 payment.=\n=20\nAs Enron shares plunged last fall, the company also considered postponing a=\n planned \"blackout\" during which time employees wouldn't be able to change =\ntheir investments or sell Enron stock, said Ms. Olson and Enron benefits ma=\nnager Mikie Rath. Ms. Olson said she finally decided against a delay after =\nconsulting with other Enron executives and an outside lawyer several days b=\nefore the scheduled blackout that began on Oct. 26 last year and lasted for=\n about 10 trading days. She said the lawyer had advised Enron to go ahead w=\nith the blackout, on the grounds that it wouldn't be able to notify in time=\n all employees -- specifically about 11,000 retirees and other workers base=\nd outside of the Houston headquarters -- about a potential postponement.=20\nExecutives from Northern Trust Retirement Consulting LLC and Hewitt Associa=\ntes LLC, the companies that managed Enron's 401(k) plans, confirmed that th=\ney were contacted about the possibility of delaying the blackout period.=20\nMs. Olson said Enron hired counsel in early November to seek legal advice o=\nn whether it \"made sense\" to advise employees on selling their Enron stockh=\noldings.=20\nThis week's hearings are intended to generate more information for lawmaker=\ns who will decide whether retirement plans ought to be more carefully regul=\nated. House Energy and Commerce Chairman W.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin (R., La.) says=\n a top priority this year will be legislation aimed at protecting workers s=\nuch as those at Enron. \"Clearly, we need pension reform,\" Mr. Tauzin, the l=\neading congressional investigator into Enron, said in an interview.=20\nHowever, retirement-plan experts say any significant change will be an uphi=\nll battle, as employer groups, Republicans, and the Bush administration opp=\nose an overhaul -- in particular, any limits on company stock in retirement=\n plans.=20\nSomewhat less controversial are proposals, by Democrats and more recently b=\ny President Bush and Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Ben Cardin (D., Md.), that =\nwould provide employees greater ability to diversify out of stock contribut=\ned by their employer. Many employers now lock workers into such shares unti=\nl age 50 or later.=20\nOn this issue, there may be more opportunity for compromise, since so far, =\nall proposals still leave employers with the freedom to lock employees into=\n company stock for long periods. Mr. Bush's proposal has the weakest divers=\nification provisions, as it exempts many defined contribution savings plans=\n from proposed diversification rules, particularly ESOPs, which hundreds of=\n large employers use. Consequently, employers could continue to lock worker=\ns into company stock in many plans until age 55 and later.=20\n---=20\nGreg Hitt contributed to this article.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But after the debate on=\n the eve of the moratorium, they imposed the so-called blackout period to g=\nive themselves time to replace the administrators of the retirement plan.\nEnron executives said they decided it would be too hard to notify the parti=\ncipants in the company's 401(k) plan immediately. They also said they feare=\nd they would open themselves to lawsuits by plan participants who were noti=\nfied about the delay later than others for reasons like mail delays.=20\nThe disclosures on the pension plan came as other Congressional committees =\ntook up Enron matters.=20\nHouse and Senate lawmakers issued subpoenas to compel the testimony of Enro=\nn's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, while Congressional and state o=\nfficials broadened their investigations into why state pension funds and st=\nate agencies invested and did business with Enron as it spiraled downward l=\nast year.=20\nThe Senate Commerce Committee voted unanimously to issue the subpoena to re=\nquire Mr. Lay's appearance next Tuesday. A similar subpoena was issued by R=\nepresentative Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the =\nHouse Financial Services Committee.=20\n", "sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions (major papers only) -- 02/06/02"}, "op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "logical_op_id": "a431944fa4", "op_name": "LLMConvertBonded", "time_per_record": 2.148866891860962, "cost_per_record": 0.008905, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions (major papers only) -- 02/06/02"}, "input_fields": ["contents", "filename"], "generated_fields": ["sender", "subject"], "total_input_tokens": 3422.0, "total_output_tokens": 35.0, "total_input_cost": 0.008555, "total_output_cost": 0.00035000000000000005, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 2.1431081295013428, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": false, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "prompt_strategy": "PromptStrategy.DSPY_COT_QA", "image_conversion": "False", "inputSchema": "TextFile(contents, filename)", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "cardinality": "one-to-one", "udf": "None"}}, {"record_id": "d478d3c7c6", "record_parent_id": "9c3089e1cc", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/martin-t-inbox-16-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "martin-t-inbox-16-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <20131220.1075841148744.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 6 Feb 2002 05:36:49 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: enerfax1@bellsouth.net\nTo: enerfaxweb@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Enerfax Daily's free web version of gas & power prices and info\n (unknown)\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: enerfax1@bellsouth.net@ENRON\nX-To: Enerfaxweb@yahoogroups.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Martin, Thomas A.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: MARTIN-T\nX-FileName: tom martin 6-25-02.PST\n\n\n\nEnerfax Daily\nNORTH AMERICA'S FREE POWER AND GAS INFORMATION SOURCE=20\n   Wednesday, February 6 2002 No. 928\nVisit: http://www.enerfax.com  to view our web version or for Oil Prices & =\nNews http://www.enerfaxgold.com=20\n\nPHYSICAL NATURAL GAS PRICES  =20\nGulf/Eastern Region    =20\n| Agua Dulce              | 2.08  |\n| ANR SE                  | 2.14  |\n| Carthage TG             | 2.13  |\n| Chicago Citygate        | 2.20  |\n| Columbia Gulf Onshore   | 2.18  |\n| Dominion South Point    | 2.46  |\n| Henry Hub               | 2.20  |\n| Houston Ship Channel    | 2.19  |\n| Katy Hub                | 2.12  |\n| NGPL LA Pool            | 2.14  |\n| NGPL - Midcontinent     | 2.09  |\n| NGPL STX                | 2.09  |\n| NGPL TX/OK              | 2.12  |\n| NNG Demarc.             | 2.15  |\n| Niagara                 | 2.46  |\n| Sonat Tier 1            | 2.16  |\n| TCO IPP Pool            | 2.29  |\n| Tetco ELa               | 2.18  |\n| Tetco M-3               | 2.69  |\n| Tetco STX               | 2.11  |\n| TGP Zone 0              | 2.10  |\n| TGP Zone 1 (500 Leg)    | 2.16  |\n| TGT Zone SL             | 2.18  |\n| New York Citygate       | 3.00  |\n| Transco Station 65      | 2.22  |\n| Transco Zone 6 (NY)     | 3.00  |\n| Trunk ELa               | 2.14  |\n| Western Region         =20\n| California Border       | 2.16  |\n| El Paso Keystone        | 2.04  |\n| El Paso San Juan-Blanco | 2.05  |\n| Waha Hub                | 2.08  |\n| Canadian/Rockies Region=20\n| Nova/Aeco (C$/gig)      | 2.83  |\n| Dawn Hub/Union          | 2.29  |\n| Northwest Stanfield     | 1.99  |\n| Wyoming Pool            | 1.91  |\n| Opal                    | 1.91  |\n| PGT-Malin               | 2.08  |\n| Sumas                   | 1.95  |\nFlow Date 2/6\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nNATURAL GAS FUTURES\nHenry Hub=20\n12 Month Strip  2.4864  -0.0152      =20\n18 Month Strip  2.5950  -0.0073   =20\n| Month | High  |  Low  | Close | Change |\n|  MAR  | 2.140 | 2.070 | 2.074 | -0.043 |\n|  APR  | 2.200 | 2.150 | 2.152 | -0.032 |\n|  MAY  | 2.260 | 2.220 | 2.227 | -0.025 |\n|  JUN  | 2.325 | 2.290 | 2.297 | -0.020 |\n|  JUL  | 2.385 | 2.355 | 2.362 | -0.015 |\n|  AUG  | 2.435 | 2.415 | 2.419 | -0.013 |\n|  SEP  | 2.440 | 2.422 | 2.422 | -0.010 |\n|  OCT  | 2.460 | 2.440 | 2.450 | -0.009 |\n|  NOV  | 2.690 | 2.670 | 2.670 | -0.009 |\n|  DEC  | 2.895 | 2.870 | 2.873 | -0.006 |\n|  JAN  | 2.990 | 2.965 | 2.968 | -0.001 |\n|  FEB  | 2.940 | 2.920 | 2.923 | +0.001 |\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-\nRISK MANAGEMENT=20\nAcross the Energy Enterprise\n\ne-Acumen, Inc., is uniquely positioned to help you manage risk and increase=\n value.

The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu. The mark=\net dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the session bet=\nween $2.10  $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as locals sold down =\nthe contract to the $2.07 support level and went home short. The AGA will r=\nelease this weeks storage report this afternoon, and while some traders are=\n predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf withdrawal, look for the numbe=\nr to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in the Midwest and Texas, the growi=\nng differential between cash and futures, and the perceived premium in the =\nearly March contract have kept the market from dropping further. Physical p=\nrices retained their premium over futures yesterday on short-term cold weat=\nher at some pipelines, maintaining about a $0.07  $0.10 premium over the NY=\nMEX. But cash traders expect the demand to ease quickly as temperatures mod=\nerate by t! his weekend. As usual, the market will look to the weekly stora=\nge report for short term direction, but it is the massive amount of volumes=\n still in storage compared to last year that has put a cap on longer term p=\nrice increases. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada =\nwas generally flat to plus or minus a few cents yesterday.

In testimony before the House Ene=\nrgy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that Enron had a $500 million loss =\nin March. Rather than report it to shareholders, Enron gave a partnership c=\nalled Raptor another $800 million in Enron shares. He said that there is no=\n doubt that almost everyone, from the board of directors on down, knew that=\n the company was attempting to offset investment losses with stock. The par=\ntnerships allowed Enron to misrepresent earnings for a period spanning the =\n3rd quarter of 2000 through the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers t=\nold that committee that over 70% of Enrons earnings for that period were fa=\nlse. He said that there were red flags that should have alerted former chai=\nrman Ken L! ay to what was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely under=\nstood that Enron was using its own stock to offset the losses in the partne=\nrships.=20\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFAST.

The seven-member executive committee of the company's board approved a=\n management proposal to provide several hundred million dollars in loan gua=\nrantees for a new partnership named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.\nWhile Enron had done business with previous partnerships, Chewco Investment=\ns was different. Unlike others where Enron had an ownership stake, Chewco w=\nas supposed to be completely independent. But it would be run and partly ow=\nned by an Enron executive, a young rising star named Michael Kopper.=20\nEnron Chairman Kenneth Lay arrived a little late, according to minutes of t=\nhe meeting obtained by The Wall Street Journal. He came in while Andrew Fas=\ntow, then senior vice president of finance, outlined a transaction that wou=\nld allow Chewco to buy, for $383 million, part of Enron's stake in another =\nlimited partnership known as JEDI. The deal kept JEDI in the Enron family, =\nbut off its books. That's because under accounting rules, Chewco provided e=\nnough independent ownership of JEDI to let Enron treat it as separate.=20\nHowever, with Enron financial guarantees and an Enron official at the helm,=\n there were questions from the beginning of how independent Chewco really w=\nas. Chewco thus set the pattern for a series of transactions that would mas=\nsively inflate Enron's earnings, while hiding billions in debt from shareho=\nlders and creditors.=20\nFour years later, on Nov. 8 last year, Enron acknowledged in a federal fili=\nng that it had overstated earnings by nearly $600 million since 1997. About=\n two-thirds of that, it told the Securities and Exchange Commission, was be=\ncause Chewco and JEDI had improperly been treated as separate entities able=\n to do income-producing deals with Enron. The disclosure sent a signal that=\n Enron hadn't been playing straight, and what had been an exodus of investo=\nrs and trading partners turned into a stampede. Within a month, Enron sough=\nt bankruptcy-law protection.=20\nFederal investigators and private litigators are now intently trying to lea=\nrn who knew what about Chewco, and when. Top former officials have distance=\nd themselves from it. In October, after the Journal first disclosed Chewco'=\ns existence, Mr. Lay privately told other Enron officials that he had never=\n heard of the partnership, according to one company executive. His wife, Li=\nnda Lay, told NBC recently that her husband had been kept in the dark about=\n a lot of the company's doings. Mr. Lay, who resigned from Enron last month=\n, couldn't be reached for comment and his attorney didn't return calls.=20\nJeffrey Skilling, who resigned suddenly as Enron's chief executive last sum=\nmer, said in press interviews late in December that he knew few details abo=\nut the partnership. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling said, \"We are=\nn't going to comment on leaks, counter-leaks, spin or speculation.\" An atto=\nrney for Mr. Kopper declined to comment. An attorney for Mr. Fastow said on=\nly that his client didn't have any financial interest in Chewco.=20\nThe meeting's minutes and other recently obtained documents show plenty of =\npeople at Enron knew about Chewco. Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Fastow were pa=\nrt of the 1997 executive-committee meeting. So were several board members. =\nOne -- Herbert \"Pug\" Winokur Jr., chairman of Capricorn Holdings Inc. in Gr=\neenwich, Conn. -- felt comfortable enough with Chewco that he approved its =\ncreation from an airport while boarding a flight.=20\nW. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for Mr. Winokur and other outside directors,=\n says the executive committee was told that \"Chewco was a special-purpose v=\nehicle not affiliated with the company. The board never waived the conflict=\n-of-interest policy for Mr. Kopper nor was the board told that Mr. Kopper w=\nas involved with Chewco.\" The meeting minutes indicate that Mr. Kopper was =\nin attendance, though the document misspells his name. The minutes don't sh=\now whether he was introduced or took part.=20\nDuring the presentation about Chewco, the meeting minutes say, Mr. Fastow \"=\nreviewed the economics of the project, the financing arrangements and the c=\norporate structure.\" Among the benefits the partnership was supposed to bri=\nng was \"positive income impact to Enron,\" according to a handout appended t=\no the minutes. The handout included diagrams of the complex financial struc=\nture.=20\nChewco isn't an issue just for Enron. Joseph Berardino, chief executive of =\nlongtime Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP, told Congress in December that =\nhis firm never would have let Enron treat Chewco and JEDI as arm's-length, =\nseparate entities had it known the entire truth about the entities' financi=\nng arrangements. At the time Chewco was being formed, Enron officials told =\nBarclays PLC, a lender involved in the deal, that Andersen had reviewed the=\n transaction's structure and approved it, according to someone familiar wit=\nh the discussions.=20\nA Barclays spokesman declines to comment. Andersen says Mr. Berardino, who =\nis scheduled to testify again next week before a House committee, stands by=\n his statement that his firm didn't know all the relevant facts about Chewc=\no four years ago.=20\nChewco altered a financial tool long used by the energy industry. Enron had=\n at times relied on off-balance-sheet partnerships and similar entities, as=\n had many competitors. Traditional \"off-balance-sheet financing is the tech=\nnique that has been used to build the independent power industry in the Uni=\nted States,\" says Didi Lacher, a New York executive of the German financial=\n firm Helaba. With such entities, companies can share the cost and risk of =\ndeveloping, say, a well or pipeline. By having the partnership borrow the m=\noney, the company can also keep the debt off its own balance sheet.=20\nThis financing is \"nonrecourse,\" meaning the sponsoring company isn't on th=\ne hook for the debt. But Enron kept off its balance sheet some debt in whic=\nh it had to cover any shortfalls, because of the partnerships' arrangements=\n. Over time, Enron accumulated billions of dollars of potential liability, =\nlittle of it publicly evident.=20\nTo do outside partnerships, some basic accounting guidelines have to be fol=\nlowed. The company has to relinquish control of any assets put into the par=\ntnership. It can't have side deals that oblige it to repurchase or redeem t=\nhe assets during the partnerships' lives, typically five to 10 years. Since=\n 1996, a partnership also has had to attract outside equity equal to at lea=\nst 3% of its total capital in order to be considered separate from the spon=\nsoring company. Enron's partnerships appear to have met these standards for=\n many years, but eventually Enron started to look at a higher-octane partne=\nrship.=20\nEnron under Mr. Lay assembled a team of bright young executives intent on b=\nuilding a global energy power. Led by Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co.=\n consultant, the core of the team started working together at Enron Capital=\n and Trade Resources, which handled energy trading and marketing. His lieut=\nenants included Mr. Fastow, a former Continental Bank finance specialist, a=\nnd Richard Causey, a former Andersen official.=20\nThey figured that for Enron to grow quickly, it couldn't be weighed down wi=\nth debt. Too much debt would threaten the company's credit rating and make =\nits financing costs higher.=20\nMr. Skilling and his subordinates placed an emphasis on rapid-fire trading =\nand deal-making, rather than on long-term investments in power plants and o=\nther \"hard\" assets. The traditional partnership approach was too cumbersome=\n", "sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions -- 02/01/02"}, "op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "logical_op_id": "a431944fa4", "op_name": "LLMConvertBonded", "time_per_record": 2.257085084915161, "cost_per_record": 0.009262500000000002, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions -- 02/01/02"}, "input_fields": ["contents", "filename"], "generated_fields": ["sender", "subject"], "total_input_tokens": 3553.0, "total_output_tokens": 38.0, "total_input_cost": 0.008882500000000002, "total_output_cost": 0.00038, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 2.2541120052337646, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": false, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "prompt_strategy": "PromptStrategy.DSPY_COT_QA", "image_conversion": "False", "inputSchema": "TextFile(contents, filename)", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "cardinality": "one-to-one", "udf": "None"}}, {"record_id": "f83e21c332", "record_parent_id": "7f7f865647", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/martin-t-inbox-53-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "martin-t-inbox-53-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <14245959.1075841159606.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Thu, 31 Jan 2002 08:54:43 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nTo: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nSubject: Enron Mentions -- 01/31/02\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain;

Daniel Bayly, Merrill's investment-banking chief; and Schuyler Tilney, who heads Merrill's energy investment-banking department and directly oversees the firm's dealing with Enron on corporate-finance matters, the people said.\nThough each executive invested less than $1 million, the people said, their involvement highlights the role played by senior Wall Street officials in helping to create some of the partnerships Enron used to pad its earnings and hide debt from investors -- and that eventually resulted in huge losses that led to the energy-trading company's downfall. \nMr. Davis, Mr. Tilney and Mr. Bayly didn't return calls for comment. Joseph Cohen, a Merrill spokesman, said the investments were entirely appropriate, and common on Wall Street. \nThe personal investments were part of a total of $22 million Merrill and its officials committed to invest in the partnership, known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. This partnership was particularly controversial because it allowed some Enron officials to make far more money working part time on the partnerships than they did working full time for Enron. The energy company has estimated, for instance, that Andrew Fastow, whom Enron replaced as chief financial officer in October as pressures on the company mounted, made more than $30 million since 1999 running LJM2 and a smaller partnership, called LJM Cayman LP. \nAt issue for Merrill is the potential for conflicts of interest. Merrill, like other Wall Street firms, wore a number of hats with Enron: The securities firm acted at various times as securities underwriter and investor with the energy company. Since 1990, Merrill was among the top five underwriters of Enron's stock and bond deals, according to Thomson Financial, earning fees for helping to raise about $3.7 billion in securities issues for the company. Thus, some critics question whether Merrill officials would let their personal investments with Enron entities interfere with their business decisions in dealing with the energy company. \n\"Merrill's involvement as underwriter for Enron and its executives' investments raises serious conflict-of-interest questions,\" says Jacob Zamansky, a New York-based plaintiffs' lawyer. \"It gives the appearance that Merrill did this to get Enron deals. Merrill had a vested interest in . . . the partnership and investing\" in it. \nThere are other conflicts as well, securities lawyers say. Some top executives at Merrill declined to invest their money because they believed that the Enron partnership -- which kept assets off Enron's balance sheet -- wouldn't get the best investments, which would be kept by the corporate parent. Another concern: Enron's Mr. Fastow suggested the idea of investing in the partnership to Mr. Tilney, whose wife until last week was a managing director of Enron's energy-services unit. Mr. Fastow through a spokesman had no comment. \nIt is unclear if top Merrill executives, who also worked on Enron's financings, had more information about the nature of the LJM2 partnership than Merrill's individual customers who were offered opportunities to invest in the partnership. \"I'm not saying that Merrill violated the law here,\" says John Coffee, a professor of securities law at Columbia University in New York. \"But this is a big public-policy issue. Merrill has an obligation, because Enron is a client, not to reveal some confidential information, but it also has a fiduciary obligation to its investors to tell them if these securities aren't suitable for them.\" \nMr. Cohen, the Merrill spokesman, brushes aside such concerns. \"The investment partnership was reviewed and deemed appropriate by parties on all sides of the transaction,\" Mr. Cohen said, reading from a prepared statement. \"Consistent with common industry practice, it was offered to qualified external as well as internal investors, and this is not a conflict of interest.\" \nMr. Cohen added that Merrill high-net-worth clients \"in the partnership offering were given the same information as all Merrill executives who wanted to invest.\" \nMr. Davis, who at the time of the investment headed the institutional-securities group, appears to be the only official on Merrill's executive committee to have invested in the partnership. Even though close to 100 Merrill executives invested in the partnership, neither Chief Executive Officer David Komansky nor his heir apparent, President E. Stanley O'Neal, were in the group, people close to the deal said. One person with knowledge of the matter said some top executives balked at investing their own money because they were uncomfortable with some LJM2 investments. Mr. Davis, however, headed the institutional group, which counted Enron as one of its big clients. \nMerrill, which helped market LJM2 to more than three dozen institutional and individual investors, was only one of many Wall Street firms to invest in the $386.6 million partnership. Other corporate investors in the partnership included Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., two units of Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., First Union Corp. and the CIBC World Markets unit of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \nThe funds for a $15 million investment from J.P. Morgan Chase came from the private-equity unit of J.P. Morgan, which invests the firm's own funds. While individual Morgan bankers may have stakes in those funds, they didn't have any direct, separate stakes in LJM2, a spokeswoman said. \nAt Citigroup and Lehman Brothers, which committed $10 million each, and CIBC World Markets, which committed $15 million, the funds came from the firms' own assets and not from outside clients or individual investment bankers, according to people familiar with the investments. \nOfficials declined to comment at CSFB, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, whose DLJ Fund Investment Partners III LP made a $5 million commitment, while a CSFB affiliate named Merchant Capital Inc. committed $10 million. Company representatives had no comment at Deutsche Bank, where an affiliate of its former Bankers Trust unit, BT Investment Partners, committed $10 million, and First Union, whose First Union Investors Inc. committed $25 million. \nOfficials at some of these Wall Street firms said their investment committees felt pressured to make the investments in order to stay in the running for investment-banking assignments. Some bankers were concerned about whether they were being asked to make uneconomical investments in corporate castoffs that wouldn't appreciate in value. Indeed, it is unclear what returns, if any, the LJM2 partnership investment has generated for limited partners and investors. \nWall Street securities firms have long made investments associated with their investment-banking business. Sometimes the investments are made to provide extra capital to help clients complete deals. Sometimes the investments are used to acquire an asset a client wants to sell. The funds may come from the securities firm itself, from investment clients, or individuals at the firm who may be offered the chance to make the investments as part of their compensation packages. \nWhat was unusual about the Merrill investment in the Enron vehicle was that some senior bankers chose not to participate out of concern about what the partnership would invest in. In addition, some of Merrill's top executives, including Mr. Komansky, Merrill's chief executive, had been embarrassed in 1998 by disclosure that they had taken personal stakes in Long-Term Capital Management, the highflying hedge fund for which Merrill had raised funds and whose near collapse jeopardized the entire U.S. financial system.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

A case study in corporate rot.\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\nBy Jake Tapper\nJan. 29, 2002 | When she heard that Kristina Mordaunt had been mixed up in Enron's infamous LJM partnership, Julia Murray broke down in tears. \nMurray, an Enron in-house counsel, wasn't known within the firm for such emotional displays. Enron was a hard-charging company that attracted tough-as-nails Type A executives and lawyers. But Kristina Mordaunt, a fellow Enron attorney who had worked in the counsel's office before joining the company's financial division, was Murray's close friend. And the news about her was rather shocking: On Nov. 7, 2001, Mordaunt was fired and escorted from the Enron building in downtown Houston by company security. According to four current or former Enron executives, Mordaunt was fired after the company found that she had made a windfall profit off LJM, one of the controversial -- and possibly illegal -- partnerships set up by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. \nAccording to these sources, there is a lesson in Kristina Mordaunt's downfall. The ignominious exit of employees like Mordaunt, who had enjoyed the trust and respect of fellow company attorneys and managers, shows how Enron's corporate culture rotted from within, under the twin pressures of financial ambition and personal greed. \nA few weeks before Mordaunt was fired, Enron had announced that her former boss Fastow was on a \"leave of absence.\" But few inside the company expected him back. On Oct. 31, Enron had reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission had upgraded its interest in the company's financial dealings from an inquiry to a formal investigation. Within Enron, the board of directors set up a special internal committee to investigate the company's convoluted finances as well. Soon, according to the four Enron sources, the committee stumbled upon stunning news: Working with Fastow, Mordaunt and Enron treasurer Ben Glisan had invested around $6,000 apiece in LJM, one of the limited partnerships Enron had established to hide its debt. Within a few weeks, they each made approximately $1 million from those investments. Enron later revealed that Fastow himself, the financial wizard behind the partnerships scheme, earned as much as $30 million from his role in managing the partnerships. \nDue to Enron's complex -- some think purposely confusing -- financial arrangements, those numbers could not be confirmed with documentation, though they were reported to Salon by the four current or former Enron executives. A congressional investigator also informed Salon that his committee has been given the same information and is currently trying to verify the charge. \nWhat is clear is that Mordaunt and Glisan were key members of the team Fastow worked with to set up these questionable partnerships, and they appear to have benefited dramatically. \"Mordaunt, for all practical purposes, was Fastow's lawyer at Enron\" since she was \"the top lawyer in his division,\" at the time, said one former Enron executive. After working for Fastow, Mordaunt later became chief counsel for a separate Enron division called EBS -- which itself was involved in highly questionable accounting activities. \nMordaunt could not be reached for comment by Salon, but according to a former Enron employee, \"She has told people that she doesn't think she did anything wrong.\" \nGlisan declined to comment. \"I've been advised not to talk to anybody,\" he told Salon. Glisan referred calls to his attorney, Hank Schuelke, with the Washington, D.C., law firm Janis Schuelke & Wechsler. Asked about the allegation against Glisan, Bill Shields, an attorney with the firm, said only, \"We're not going to have any comment.\" \nSo far, according to the congressional investigator, the world knows \"just the tip of the iceberg\" about what drove Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, into the biggest U.S. bankruptcy of all time, depriving investors and employees of at least $1 billion. Up to this point, most of the public's attention has been focused on Enron's political connections and the failure of Wall Street's so-called gatekeepers -- the analysts, banks, credit agencies and analysts -- to sound a warning bell. But the inside story of Enron's corporate culture -- as the company transformed itself from an energy trader whose business was rooted in the physical delivery of gas and electricity into a high-finance wheeler-dealer whose business was primarily manipulating numbers -- is just coming to light. This part of the story is about greed, betrayal and deception -- and its human costs, in broken friendships, ruined careers and worse. \nThe apparent suicide of former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Baxter on Friday might be the most dramatic example so far of this human cost. But Enron's corporate ranks have been suffering many shocks since last fall -- and the revelation about Mordaunt and Glisan was one of them. Many executives were stunned to learn that these two trusted co-workers and friends had been raking in such extraordinary amounts of cash. Though Julia Murray declined to comment to Salon, her tearful reaction to the news about her friend Mordaunt last November indicate the deep emotional wounds inflicted by some of Enron's suddenly rich managers as they grabbed their cash and ran for the door.\n\"Did I feel betrayed? Yeah, a lot,\" said an Enron executive and friend of both Mordaunt and Glisan who would speak with Salon only on the condition of anonymity. \"I was extremely surprised.\" \nAfter the news about Mordaunt and Glisan broke inside the company, colleagues rushed to see who else might have been involved in the scandal. After Mordaunt was escorted out of the Enron building, said one executive, \"I called a number of people I know who work in the finance division and said, 'Please tell me that you didn't invest in LJM!\" \nLJM along with LJM2 and Chewco have become the most notorious of the shady accounting partnerships set up by Enron. Set up, it is now believed, specifically to hide Enron debt from public scrutiny, the partnerships proved to be the catalyst for Enron's fall. \nOn Nov. 8, 2001, the same day the company announced that its financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 \"should not be relied upon,\" Enron filed an \"8-K\" form -- an interim document required for certain types of financial events -- with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In that form, <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/> Enron disclosed that some of the \"limited partners\" in the partnerships \"were, at the time of the investment, non-executive officers or employees of Enron.\" Enron also announced that it was \"terminating the employment\" of Glisan and Mordaunt for participating in the LJM partnerships. \n\"At the time these individuals invested in the limited partnership, LJM1 had ceased entering into new transactions with Enron,\" Enron's 8-K stated. \"However, some pre-existing investments involving LJM1 and Enron were still in effect, and Enron believes that these investments resulted in distributions or payments to LJM1 and to the limited partnership in which these individuals invested.\" \nAccording to the congressional investigator, Mordaunt reaped her LJM windfall after she was approached by an Enron executive, who asked her if she wanted to make some money. Yes, she said. \"Give me a check for $6,000,\" he told her, according to the congressional investigator. Later, the executive asked Mordaunt for her bank account number so he could deposit the proceeds from her investment. \"How much is it?\" she asked. He told her to check her bank account the next day. When she did, she discovered over $1 million had been deposited into her account. The congressional committee is currently investigating the matter. \nThe Nov. 8 SEC filing also clarified Fastow's role in the company. He was no longer officially on a leave of absence. He \"is no longer working for Enron,\" the filing stated. \nAt a November news conference, then-CEO Kenneth Lay reported that he knew about the partnerships but not about Mordaunt's and Glisan's role in them. \nAsked last week about the allegations against Mordaunt and Glisan, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said, \"I have no idea.\" Palmer noted that a special committee had been appointed \"to look into\" such matters. \"I know they're looking into everything surrounding those transactions,\" he said, referring to the partnerships. \nSaid another former Enron executive after hearing about Mordaunt's and Glisan's lucrative deals: \"Hillary Clinton should have gone to their school of futures trading.\" \nTo many of their former colleagues, Mordaunt's and Glisan's closeness to Fastow's suspicious transactions makes things look even worse. \"To many of us, this looks and smells like a bribe,\" said one Enron former employee. \"'I' -- Fastow -- 'will give you money, you shut up.' Or put another way, 'Here is the payoff for helping me set up the structures that helped me rake in more than $30 million.'\" The two weren't merely \"Enron executives,\" the former employee says, \"they were the treasurer and one of the top lawyers in the company. And both of them worked on LJM-related deals. That is what makes it sickening.\" \nThe accusations highlight the personal betrayal many Enron executives feel. After Mordaunt and Glisan were fired last November, their former colleagues spent much time trying to figure out how it all could have happened. \nMordaunt, according to a current Enron executive, \"was very tight with Andy [Fastow]. Andy was responsible for making her managing director, and she would have done anything for him.\" Nonetheless, as a lawyer, Mordaunt should have known better, the executive said. \"Given his connection with LJM, which was dicey at best and at worst probably illegal, I personally would have stayed far away from it. But you never know how Andy spun it to her.\" \nAfter working as Fastow's top lawyer, Mordaunt later served as chief counsel for EBS, an Enron subsidiary set up specifically to handle another complex partnership, code-named Braveheart. In Braveheart, Enron sold 10 years' worth of future revenue from a broadband interactive television deal it was setting up with Blockbuster. Although the deal itself never went past the testing stage, Enron booked $110 million worth of revenue for selling off those future, never-to-be-realized earnings. \nGlisan also played a key role in Fastow's division, a former Enron executive noted: \"All the deals we did had to go through Glisan and get his approval because of the impact on funds flow.\" The former executive, like others affiliated with the firm, said that he once had a positive impression of Glisan and was surprised to learn that he had been an LJM investor. \nTo some current and former Enron executives, the transformation of respected managers like Mordaunt and Glisan represented a major shift in the company ethos. \"In my opinion this all goes back to when Jeff Skilling took over and Enron ceased being an energy company and we became an earnings company,\" said one former executive, referring to Enron's metamorphosis into a company that focused more on highly complex financial-derivatives trading than on actual commodities. \nIn 1997, Skilling became the company's president and chief operating officer. Press accounts of Enron's rise traditionally gave him credit for Enron's increasing focus on complex financing schemes and risky leaps into such areas as bandwidth trading, an enterprise that ended up costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars. \nSkilling was \"all hype,\" the one-time executive says. \"Everything he did was to hype the stock. And they had this need to create complex financial dealings to hide all the things going wrong. \n\"Once we became an earnings-focused company, that was the beginning of the end.\" The former executive said he's still unsure whether recently resigned CEO Lay knew everything that was going on. \"But that doesn't excuse him. Captain Joe Hazelwood didn't know that the guy was going to run the Valdez into the reef. But he was Captain Hazelwood. It was his ship.\" \nThe company's business practices changed under Skilling, this former executive said. And so did the attitudes of managers like Mordaunt and Glisan -- and Lay, for that matter. Keeping the stock price up, at all costs, became the order of the day, even if that meant telling employees all was fine, when in fact the company's situation was rapidly deteriorating. \n\"[Lay] lied to us starting in August,\" said the former executive. \"He lied to us.\" In August, Lay went before the company and announced that Skilling was resigning for personal reasons. In an all-employees meeting, Lay told a touching tale about why Skilling felt the need to leave the company. \nSkilling, Lay said, had recently visited the Teesside Power Station, Enron's gas-fired power plant in northeast England, where an Aug. 8 explosion and fire had killed three Enron employees. \"It shook him up so much he realized how much he had sacrificed with his own family,\" one executive recalled Lay saying. \"And he wanted to spend more time with his kids.\" Lay then told the company more lies, according to the executive: that Enron had just enjoyed the best quarter in its history; that it was going to be more friendly to Wall Street; it was going to simplify its accounting practices; there were no other people other than Fastow involved in the shady partnerships. \n\"About two weeks later, the news came out about Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt,\" recalled the executive. Soon afterward, the company was told that \"we would have to restate our earnings for the past five years.\" \nThen came the news that executives like Lay had been dumping their stock for years while simultaneously telling stockholders and employees that all was fine and the stock would soon bounce back. In hindsight, few Enron executives believe that Skilling's departure had anything to do with the Teesside Power Station tragedy. \n\"Lay got in front of the entire company and just lied,\" said the executive, who has lost his life savings. \"I feel like a schmuck.\" \n\nsalon.com \n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nA Section\nEnron Directors Backed Moving Debt Off Books\nKathleen Day and Peter Behr\nWashington Post Staff Writers\n\n01/31/2002\nThe Washington Post\nFINAL\nA01\nCopyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved\n\nMembers of Enron Corp.'s board of directors received detailed briefings as early as four years ago about the purpose and structure of controversial partnerships whose losses triggered the company's fall into bankruptcy, according to minutes of the meetings. \nThe minutes, which cover four board meetings in 1997 and 1999 and three meetings of the board's finance committee in 2000, suggest that board members approved aggressive accounting actions, including moving debt off the company books.\nA dozen congressional committees as well as the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's collapse, which cost investors and employees billions of dollars. A focus of the inquiries is whether Enron hid debt and inflated its profits by using the private partnerships run by its chief financial officer. \nIn other Enron-related news yesterday, the General Accounting Office announced that it would sue the White House for access to records of Vice President Cheney's meetings with Enron and other industry interests that sought to influence the administration's energy policy last year. And Stephen Cooper, the interim head of Enron, said he was optimistic the company could survive, though in a much diminished form. \nIndividual Enron board members, who themselves are being sued and investigated, have said little publicly about their role in the transactions that toppled the company. The minutes, made available to The Washington Post by a source critical of the board, suggest that the partnerships were a key part of Enron's growth strategy and show they were regularly reviewed by the directors. \nThe copies of the minutes do not cover every board meeting and do not include documents that are referred to as being attached to the summaries of the board's actions. \nWhen it was reported last fall that Andrew Fastow, the Enron CFO, made $30 million running partnerships with names such as LJM, Raptor and JEDI, then-chairman Kenneth L. Lay announced that the board was setting up a special committee to investigate. The minutes show that members of that special committee attended board meetings in which Fastow described the intricacy of the entities. \nSources said the committee's report, which is expected to be completed as early as tomorrow, will say that while the Enron board approved the partnerships, management and auditors withheld key information from them. That is expected to be the key element of the defense that will be offered by Lay and board member William C. Powers Jr. when they testify before Congress on Monday, sources said. Last night, Robert Bennett, a Washington lawyer representing Enron, gave every indication that would be the case. \n\"While the board of directors, including Mr. Lay, were aware that these special partnership entities were being set up, which were being run by Mr. Fastow, there is a great deal of information regarding their operation and execution that was unknown to the board of directors,\" Bennett said. \nAt an Oct. 11, 1999, board meeting, Fastow discussed the company's mix of \"on-balance and off-balance sheet debt,\" according to the minutes. At another meeting on May 1, 2000, Fastow told board members about the risk of \"accounting scrutiny\" on the Raptor partnership. \nA board resolution in October 1999 said one purpose of the LJM2 partnership was to create \"a potential ready purchaser of the company's businesses and assets.\" A chart labeled \"LJM2 Update,\" attached to the agenda for a May 2000 finance committee meeting, said the partnership had made seven investments, all purchased from Enron. \nEnron has disclosed that the board waived the company's conflict-of-interest rules to let Fastow oversee the partnerships. \nThe board's special committee hired William R. McLucas, former head of enforcement at the SEC, to do the investigation and write a report for the committee. The report is expected to be released before Lay, who resigned last week, and board member Powers, who is also dean of the University of Texas law school, testify before Congress on Monday. \nUntil now, Congress has focused on the role Enron's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, played in the company's collapse and the reported destruction by Andersen executives of Enron-related documents. Monday's hearings are expected to zero in on the behavior of Enron officials, including the board. \nThe outside directors are expected, as part of their defense, to push the focus back on Andersen, sources say. They will point, for example, to portions of board minutes that say Andersen \"had spent considerable time analyzing . . . the governance structure\" of one of the partnerships, LJM2, and \"was comfortable with the proposed transaction.\" \nMinutes from October 1999 and October 2000 say the board ordered several safeguards be implemented to maintain control of the partnerships. One was allowing Lay or the board to remove Fastow from one partnership, LJM, at any time. Another was directing then-Enron chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling and others to review all transactions between Enron and LJM. And Skilling was to review Fastow's \"economic interest\" in the partnership. \nBennett said, \"We have learned that many of the procedures that were put into place to ensure the appropriate operation of these entities were not complied with, without the knowledge of the board.\" \nPatrick McGurn of Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. of Rockville, which advises large shareholders on corporate-governance issues, said last night that the minutes seem to provide more evidence that board members were fully informed of the company's aggressive financial strategies. \n\"If that's not the case, the directors better start talking and start talking now. Every step along the way it seems this board had the opportunity to say no to the partnerships, to the waiver of the ethics code, and each time they had an opportunity to take the right fork in the road, they took the wrong fork.\" \nThe Oct. 12, 1999, minutes show that outside director Herbert Winokur -- now a member of the board's special investigating committee -- recommended that the board approve Fastow's participation in the LJM2 partnership. \nMcGurn said, \"The first principle of an investigation is that the people who presumably might be held responsible at the end of the day can't investigate themselves.\" \nThe other two members of the special committee -- Powers and Raymond S. Troubh, a New York consultant -- had no involvement with the company when the formation of the off-balance-sheet entities took place, sources close to the company said. \nW. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the outside directors of the board, said Winokur has no conflict of interest in serving on that special committee, despite his role in approving the partnership deals. \"It was important for the special committee to render its report quickly and Mr. Winokur's participation provided continuity and speed to the special committee's efforts,\" Eggleston said. \nThe board minutes show that as early as Dec. 9, 1997, Enron's executive committee approved a buyout -- that included a corporate guarantee of $633 million -- of the interest of the California public employees pension fund in the JEDI partnership. \nAt an Aug. 7, 2000, meeting of the finance committee, chaired by Winokur, the off-balance-sheet partnerships are described as \"the vehicles the company was utilizing to manage its balance sheet debt.\" Directors Wendy Gramm and Lay were among other board members that also attended the meeting. \nAt a special board meeting on June 28, 1999, Lay called on Skilling to discuss a proposed investment partnership. \"Mr. Skilling noted that due to changes in the accounting treatment of off-balance-sheet transactions, the company had been analyzing new types of financing vehicles. He called on Mr. Fastow to discuss the proposal.\" \nSkilling resigned suddenly in August. Fastow was ousted in October. \nThe LJM partnerships were specifically cited by the company last fall when it admitted violating some accounting standards, resulting in a $586 million overstatement of its profits between 1997 and 2001. \nThe excerpts that became available yesterday give no hint that board members had questions or qualms about the accounting maneuvers, with the exception of Fastow's dual role as Enron's chief financial officer and LJM's manager. \nStaff writers David Hilzenrath, Albert B. Crenshaw and Carrie Johnson contributed to this report. Peter Behr reported from Houston.\n\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com \nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nConcerned ex-worker was sent to human resources\nHouse panel asks Lay to explain what happened to memo from former energy services manager \nBy JULIE MASON \nCopyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau \nJan. 30, 2002, 10:04PM\nWASHINGTON -- A one-time Enron Corp. manager who warned Chairman Ken Lay in August about questionable accounting practices was sent to human resources for a talk about employee morale, her attorney said Wednesday. \nHouse investigators demand Lay explain Enron's response to allegations raised in an Aug. 28 e-mail by Margaret Ceconi, who had lost her job with Enron Energy Services just over three weeks earlier. \n\"Ms. Ceconi included her home phone number in the e-mail and offered to speak to board members,\" lawmakers from the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in a letter to Lay. \"We are very interested in learning what happened to Ms. Ceconi's e-mail after you received it, and how Enron responded to it.\" \nAn Enron spokesman did not return a call for comment. \nA key issue for investigators probing the collapse of Enron is at what point executives at the company became aware of financial problems and how those problems were addressed. \nCeconi on Aug. 28 wrote a five-page memo to Lay, stating that losses in Enron Energy Services, or EES, were being moved to another sector of Enron to make EES appear profitable. \nAccording to Ceconi, the losses were hidden in Enron Wholesale Services, the company's highly profitable and well-established trading arm. \n\"Some would say the house of cards are falling,\" Ceconi said in her memo to Lay. \nDemetrios Anaipakos, Ceconi's Houston attorney, said Lay never met with Ceconi to discuss her concerns, and she was instead referred to human resources. \n\"During that meeting, the primary discussion was focused on concerns over employee morale at Enron,\" Anaipakos said. \nCeconi's memo, which was copied to a manager in human resources, detailed morale problems and related issues at EES. \nCeconi was told her accounting allegations would be taken seriously and investigated by Enron, but she never heard back, according to her lawyer. \n\"Ms. Ceconi firmly believes the allegations she raised in her memo merited response from the company, and she didn't get one,\" Anaipakos said. \nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee sent Lay 10 questions pertaining to Ceconi's memo and the company's response. Lay has until Feb. 12 to respond. \nQuestions posed to Lay in a letter signed by Rep. W.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin, R-La., committee chairman, and other members seek details on how the memo was distributed and whether Ceconi's allegations were investigated. \n", "sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions -- 01/31/02"}, "op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "logical_op_id": "a431944fa4", "op_name": "LLMConvertBonded", "time_per_record": 1.8823881149291992, "cost_per_record": 0.02191, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions -- 01/31/02"}, "input_fields": ["contents", "filename"], "generated_fields": ["sender", "subject"], "total_input_tokens": 8616.0, "total_output_tokens": 37.0, "total_input_cost": 0.02154, "total_output_cost": 0.00037000000000000005, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 1.8754148483276367, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": false, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "prompt_strategy": "PromptStrategy.DSPY_COT_QA", "image_conversion": "False", "inputSchema": "TextFile(contents, filename)", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "cardinality": "one-to-one", "udf": "None"}}, {"record_id": "ac6c1834ee", "record_parent_id": "6996dd8155", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/martin-t-inbox-96-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "martin-t-inbox-96-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <8664618.1075841171256.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 18 Jan 2002 14:32:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nTo: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nSubject: Enron Mentions -- 01/18/02\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SPALME2>\nX-To: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spalme2>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Martin, Thomas A.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: MARTIN-T\nX-FileName: tom martin 6-25-02.PST\n\n\nMore than one Enron official warned company about growing crisis\nSalon.com, 01/18/2002\n\nIf Enron isn't a political scandal, nothing is\nSalon.com, 01/18/2002\n\nUSA: Enron lawyer raised partnership concerns-Salon.com.\nReuters English News Service, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron CEO under fire again \nReport: Lay knew of accounting problems when he exercised options. \nCNN, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron Attorney Asks Judge to Approve Sale of Energy-Trading Operations\nDow Jones Business News, 01/18/2002\n\nBlackstone says Enron unit could earn 1-2 bln usd a year if UBS deal approved\nAFX News, 01/18/2002\n\nRuling on Enron sale expected Friday\nEnron fires Andersen as auditor \nCBS.MarketWatch.com, 01/18/2002\nCheney discussed Enron with Indian leader\nCNN, 01/18/2002\n\nUSA: UPDATE 2-Cheney spoke to Indian officials on Enron project.\nReuters English News Service, 01/18/2002\n\nCheney's Mention of Enron To Indian Politician Draws Attention\nCNN: Live Today, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron Fires Andersen As Auditor\nChannel 2 Houston, 01/18/2002\n\nUSA: Florida subpoenaes Enron papers in pension probe.\nReuters English News Service, 01/18/2002\n\nPOWER POINTS: Enron Energy Services Still In The Game\nDow Jones Energy Service, 01/18/2002\n\nPataki giving donation from wife of Enron chief to employees' fund\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nPetrobras Eyes Enron's Stake in TGS.\nBusiness News Americas, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron subsidiary in Bothell strapped for cash\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nUSA: UPDATE 1-Moody's may change the way it rates companies.\nReuters English News Service, 01/18/2002\n\nTHE SKEPTIC: Accountants Under The Microscope Post-Enron\nDow Jones International News, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron 'winners' outside Beltway\nNeither party can benefit\nMSNBC.com, 01/18/2002\n\nFlorida governor speaks at father's presidential museum\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nFormer Enron Lobbyist Racicot Elected Republican Chairman\nDow Jones Energy Service, 01/18/2002\n\nCarson returns Enron contribution\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nSen.

Another executive was reassigned after raising alarms.\nBy Jake Tapper, Salon.com\nJan. 18, 2002 | In recent weeks, Enron executives have insisted that their controversial -- and ultimately disastrous -- accounting strategies were legally vetted. But Salon has learned that a law firm hired secretly by one of Enron's own attorneys last year recommended that the huge energy trader stop setting up the financial instruments whose exposure later drove the company into bankruptcy. \nAt the heart of the Enron scandal are a series of complex partnerships that Enron employed to keep billions of dollars of debt off its books -- thus boosting both its quarterly profits and its credit level. Enron executives participated in these partnerships, earning millions of dollars in management fees and raising major conflict-of-interest issues. \nEmbattled Enron CEO Ken Lay has attempted to justify the partnerships by noting that Enron's own staff attorneys as well as those at Vinson & Elkins, its powerful outside law firm, signed off on them. Despite this legal advice, it was reported earlier this week that one Enron executive, Sherron S. Watkins, raised serious questions about the propriety of the partnerships in a memo sent to Lay in late August. Salon has now learned of two other major instances in which Enron executives were told by company colleagues that the partnerships were deeply troubling and possibly illegal. \nIn one case, an Enron staff attorney took the extraordinarily unusual step of secretly retaining another outside law firm to evaluate the legality of the partnerships set up by then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. \nLast summer, before Enron was forced to reveal the actual state of its finances, Fastow moved to set up more of these partnerships. But Fastow's plan was blocked when an Enron attorney named Jordan Mintz took matters into his own hands. According to sources inside Enron, Mintz, who had just moved from the company's tax department to its finance department, was so concerned about the questionable nature of the partnerships -- and apparently so worried that Enron's attorneys were too close to the business schemes to judge them correctly -- that he sought a second legal opinion. \n\nWithout the knowledge of his boss, Enron chief counsel James Derrick Jr., Mintz hired an outside firm far removed from Enron and its Houston-based firm, Vinson & Elkins, to take a fresh look at the questionable deals. After reviewing the partnerships, the respected New York firm hired by Mintz -- Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson -- recommended to him that Enron stop setting up the the shell partnerships. The New York firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to company executives urging Enron to halt the practice -- which they apparently did. In October, Enron fired Fastow. Last month, he hired celebrated attorney David Boies, who represented Vice President Al Gore during his Florida recount battles. \nContacted Wednesday night, Mintz declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege. When asked about the Mintz retention of outside counsel, Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said \"this is the first I've heard of that\" and declined to comment further. A spokesman for Fried Frank did not return a call for comment. \nWithout specifically confirming the Mintz episode, House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Ken Johnson said that worried Enron executives did go outside the company for legal advice: \"(This) happened in a couple instances. There was more than one person who was spooked by these partnerships.\" \nIt is unusual for a corporate lawyer to go behind the back of his boss, the chief counsel, and retain an outside firm to do work for a company. And it was against standard operating procedure at Enron, where chief counsel Derrick had to approve of any outside legal work. But Mintz apparently thought that Derrick, who had worked at Vinson & Elkins before joining Enron, was too much a part of the company's closed culture, in which dubious business practices had become the norm.\nNo less than 10 congressional committees are investigating the collapse of Enron, an energy trading company with close ties to politicians in general and the Bush administration in particular. On Wednesday the Senate Finance Committee joined the ranks of nine other House and Senate bodies -- as well as the Departments of Labor and Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service -- by announcing that it, too, would look into the largest bankruptcy in American history. \nOn Wednesday, investigators with the House Energy & Commerce Committee interviewed David Duncan, the former Enron auditor with Arthur Andersen who had been fired the day before. \nOne of the primary questions under investigation is why Fastow and other Enron executives were permitted to establish complex and secretive partnerships with odd, obscure names -- LJM1, LJM2, JEDI, Chewco, the Raptor entities, Osprey, Big Doe -- that allegedly reaped these partners windfall profits while hiding Enron debt. In November, Enron had to revise its finance statements for the past four and a half years, acknowledging that the company was $600 million in net income poorer than it had led the government and its investors to believe. The Houston company also had to acknowledge an additional $2.5 billion in debt -- much of which came from these murky \"partnerships.\" Recent revelations tied to the Watkins memo may result in billions more debt added to the Enron ledger. \n\"Someone should have stepped up and said, 'No, you can't do these sort of things!'\" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. But for too long no one did, the employee added. And then when someone finally spoke up, it was too late. \nCurrently, much is being made in the media of Watkins' August letter to CEO Kenneth Lay, released on Tuesday by investigators with the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals,\" Watkins wrote. \"The business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax.\" \nBut Watkins' letter, said one source, was not the only alarm being sounded within the company before it imploded. In addition to the flags raised by Watkins and Mintz, then-treasurer Jeff McMahon also aired his own growing concern. In her memo, Watkins alluded to McMahon's tribulation, writing that he \"was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of [the] LJM [partnership]. He complained mightily to [chief executive] Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later, Skilling offered him the CEO spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the five steps with him.\" \nIn the eyes of many Enron executives at the time, McMahon's new assignment was meant to silence him. McMahon \"learned about these partnerships and he thought they were wrong,\" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. \"He thought they were a huge conflict of interest.\" McMahon, according to this source, went to Skilling and said, \"'We have this problem, and I think there's a conflict.' Skilling says, 'I'll take a look at it; I'll take care of it.' And the next thing you know, he's reassigned. And it was not a promotion.\" To other executives it looked like retaliation against a whistleblower, an Enron source said. \nMcMahon \"did go to Jeff Skilling and tell him he was uncomfortable with the internal and external conflicts the LJM partnerships were creating,\" confirmed Enron spokesman Palmer. \"And he told him he could no longer serve as treasurer with those conflincts in place.\" As for whether the reassignment was a demotion of any sort, Palmer said, \"It's probably open to interpretation by a lot of people.\" \nIn August, the same month Watkins wrote her memo, Skilling himself resigned from Enron under mysterious circumstances. McMahon, who replaced Fastow as Enron's chief financial officer in October, did not return a call for comment. \n\"We hope in the very near future to be interviewing Mr. McMahon,\" House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Johnson said. \"We feel he has a lot to offer.\" Johnson's committee has uncovered a number of incriminating details in the Enron investigation, including the shredding of documents and the Watkins memo. \nA congressional source also reports that such matters may be just the tip of the iceberg, that much more damaging information will be coming out in the next few weeks dealing with the Enron partnerships. \n________\n\n\n \n\n \nIf Enron isn't a political scandal, nothing is\nSo what if Bush and company didn't bail out Enron? The outrage lies in what politicians did for the company on its way up, not the way down.\nBy Scott Rosenberg, Salon.com\nJan. 18, 2002 | The collapse of Enron, we now hear, is not a \"political scandal\" -- it's a \"business story.\" A fine distinction! So far, no one possesses evidence that government officials lied, goofed around with interns, ran guns from the White House basement, burglarized opponents' campaign offices or accepted bags of unmarked bills. And so a growing chorus in the media now chants that the Enron affair should not be considered in the same class as Whitewater, Watergate, Iran/Contra or any of the other previous brouhahas that have consumed Washington and brought presidencies to their knees. \nThis tells us that the scandal yardstick our political and media culture currently uses is bent like a pretzel. You say your president may have finagled a real estate deal many years ago? Time to name a special prosecutor! He lied about his sex life? Draw up the articles of impeachment! But tell us that a high-profile corporation donated millions of dollars to legions of politicians, including the president; bent the government to its will; lined the pockets of its executives while dodging all taxes; then went bankrupt, vaporizing thousands of employees' retirement accounts? Nah, that's no \"political scandal.\" Come on -- where're the bimbos? \nEnron's dismal story simply doesn't meet the high bar of triviality the press today demands. The sums of money involved are too great; the flaws in our political system that it exposes are too vast. It's just too real to qualify. \n\n\nUSA: Enron lawyer raised partnership concerns-Salon.com.\n\n01/18/2002\nReuters English News Service\n(C) Reuters Limited 2002.\n\nNEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - An Enron Corp. lawyer raised the alarm last summer at the energy trader about off-balance-sheet partnerships that helped drive it into bankruptcy, said Internet media company Salon.com on Friday. \nAccording to Salon.com, an Enron staff lawyer named Jordan Mintz, who was worried about the legality of the partnerships, last summer hired an outside law firm to review the complex partnerships without Enron's knowledge.\nThe law firm, Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, recommended to Mintz that Enron should stop setting up the shell partnerships, Salon.com said, citing Enron sources. \nThe New York law firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to Enron executives urging the company to halt the practice. Salon.com said Enron apparently followed the advice. \nMinz declined to comment when contacted late Wednesday, citing attorney-client privilege, and Fried Frank did not return a telephone call, Salon.com said. \nThe partnerships allowed Enron to keep debt off its books, gain higher credit ratings and help boost the company's profile among investors. Concerns about the murky partnerships led investors to dump Enron shares after the company reported its first quarterly loss in four years in October and later reduced its earnings over the same period by about $600 million. Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, the biggest in U.S. history.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nEnron CEO under fire again \nReport: Lay knew of accounting problems when he exercised options. \n\nNEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Documents say that Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay sold shares of the energy trader's stock after receiving a letter warning of an accounting problem, according to a published report Friday.\n\nThe Arthur Andersen internal memos, including a letter from employee Sherron Watkins mentioning a meeting with Lay, were released yesterday by Congress, according to the New York Times. Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, is also under investigation for its accounting methods in the case.\n\nSeparately, another report emerged late Thursday that Enron corporate lawyer, Jordan Mintz, hired law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson last summer to take another look at Enron's financial structure. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt worked at the law firm until last fall.\n\nFried Frank recommended that Enron end its partnership deals, Salon.com said.\n\nThe letter from Watkins, written Aug. 15, said she had scheduled a meeting with Lay on Aug. 20 to discuss the accounting issues. Lay exercised options on 93,620 shares for $2 million on Aug. 20 and Aug. 21, the report said.\n\nWhile Lay did not report selling the shares, worth $3.5 million at the time, Enron officials said earlier this week that some of the money went to repay a loan, according to the Times.\n\nCorporate stock sales must be disclosed by the tenth of the month in which the sale takes place, unless the shares are turned over to the company to repay a loan, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's collapse. The firm's bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2 was the largest in U.S. history.\n\nThousands of employees lost their pensions and life's savings in the former Wall Street darling's downfall, which began last autumn when the firm acknowledged several hundred million dollars of previously undisclosed liabilities.\n\nThe saga has also embroiled Andersen, whose reviews of Enron's finances have come under heavy fire amid the firm's admission that employees destroyed a large number of e-mails and documents related to an audit of the energy trader.  \n \n\nEnron Attorney Asks Judge to Approve Sale of Energy-Trading Operations\nBy Kathy Chu\n\n01/18/2002\nDow Jones Business News\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nDow Jones Newswires \nNEW YORK -- An Enron Corp. attorney implored a federal judge here to approve the sale of its energy-trading operations to UBS AG in order to bring a \"failed\" business \"back to life.\"\nMartin Bienenstock, of Weil Gotshal & Manges, which represents the bankrupt energy company, said the core operation -- which generated about 90% of Enron's (ENRNQ) $101 billion in revenue last year -- may lose its value if the deal isn't closed soon. \nIf the sale isn't approved, 600 traders and back-office staff could leave in the near future, taking their knowledge of the business with them, according to Steve Zelin, a senior managing partner in Blackstone Group's restructuring division. Blackstone serves as Enron's financial adviser in the deal. \nUnder the deal with UBS (UBS), Enron could get more than $2 billion in royalties and other payments, according to Mr. Zelin, assuming that the Swiss bank eventually exercises a buyout option of the bankrupt company's profit stake. \nUBS, which has agreed to pay Enron 33% of the trading business' pretax royalties for at least two years, may be able to satisfy part of its commitment by issuing debt to Enron. \nThe liquidation value of the trading operations is $40 million to $50 million, said Mr. Zelin. \nWrite to Kathy Chu at kathy.chu@dowjones.com \nCopyright (c) 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nRuling on Enron sale expected Friday\nEnron fires Andersen as auditor \nBy Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com\nLast Update: 8:35 AM ET Jan. 18, 2002\nNEW YORK (CBS.MW) - A bankruptcy court judge is expected to rule Friday morning on whether Enron's plan to sell its energy trading assets to investment bank UBS Warburg can go forward.\nThe ruling is expects some time after 11 AM Eastern time from judge Arthur Gonzalez, of the Federal Bankruptcy court in Manhattan.\nThe meeting was originally scheduled for Thursday, but was bumped back a day after Enron and UBS requested more time to put together details of the proposed sale .\nOn Thursday, Enron fired its auditor, Andersen, citing the accounting firm's destruction of documents related to the energy company's finances. \nSeparately, Andersen confirmed some details of a meeting in Feb. 2001 at which partners in the accounting firm debated continuing to serve as Enron's auditor despite concerns over limited partnerships formed by the energy company. \nAttorney Robert Bennett said Enron notified Andersen of the firing Thursday afternoon. \"We're very troubled about the destruction of the documents, and we're very concerned about the accounting advice we got,\" Bennett told the Associated Press. \nLate Thursday Andersen issued a news release confirming the February meeting at which Enron's limited partnerships were discussed. Andersen said the meeting was part of a routine review of risks and that no evidence of illegal actions or improper accounting was suspected during the meeting, or in a subsequent memo describing the discussions. \nEnron's formation of limited partnerships helped the company move high levels of debt off its books, improving the company's balance sheet. \nEarlier Thursday a federal judge overseeing all Enron lawsuits in Houston said she will hold a hearing Tuesday in connection with how and why Andersen destroyed Enron-related documents. \nJudge Melinda Harmon replaced Judge Lee Rosenthal this week. Rosenthal recused herself from the Enron cases with no explanation. She once was a partner at the law firm Baker & Botts, which is representing Dynegy, whose 2001 plan to merge with Enron was aborted. \nHarmon will hear Amalgamated Bank's request for expedited discovery and will consider a motion for a temporary restraining order prohibiting Andersen from destroying evidence. Andersen said it has ordered a halt to the destruction of any Enron-related documents. \nAndersen fired the man who served as its lead Enron auditor Tuesday.\nDavid Duncan, the fired Andersen partner, met Wednesday with staff and attorneys for the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He denied any wrongdoing. \nAlso on Thursday, House investigators requested that Andersen hand over additional notes or records from the 14 participants in a meeting five months ago into potential accounting landmines at Enron in a meeting five months ago. \nAmalgamated Bank is suing 29 Enron officers and directors along with Andersen for $25 billion in damages, alleging that the defendants sold more than $1 billion worth of shares while misrepresenting the financial state of the company. \nLisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com.\n\n\nCheney discussed Enron with Indian leader\n\nJanuary 18, 2002 Posted: 12:50 PM EST (1750 GMT)\n\nBy John King\nCNN Washington Bureau \n\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- Vice President Dick Cheney asked Indian opposition leader Sonia Gandhi last June about a multimillion-dollar debt owed to Enron from a major energy project in India, administration officials confirmed Friday. \nThe officials told CNN the subject came up for only a moment at a meeting at the White House, and that no one at Enron asked Cheney to raise the issue. Cheney met with Ghandi to discuss general diplomatic issues affecting the U.S. and India. \nThese two officials also noted that the taxpayer-financed Overseas Private Investment Corporation had a stake in the issue; OPIC could face payouts of perhaps $300 million, because it agreed to underwrite political risk insurance as part of the Enron deal. \nA Cheney aide said the vice president has had three meetings with Indian officials since the Bush administration took office. The $64 million Enron debt has come up just once, in the June 27th meeting with the opposition leader. \nThe aide told CNN that Enron CEO Kenneth Lay \"never asked him to do it, no one at Enron asked him to talk about it. It was in the briefing papers Cheney received in advance of the meeting, and he asked about the status of the Enron project.\" \nThe officials noted the meeting was in June; it was several months later that Enron's financial problems began to surface. \nAdministration officials say there was nothing improper about raising the Enron debt issue. But reports of Cheney's actions come at a time some Democrats in Congress are suggesting Enron benefited from its deep ties with senior Bush administration officials. \nThose Democrats are pressing for information on Enron-administration contacts and any administration actions that might have benefited Enron. \n", "sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions -- 01/18/02"}, "op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "logical_op_id": "a431944fa4", "op_name": "LLMConvertBonded", "time_per_record": 2.314940929412842, "cost_per_record": 0.015577500000000001, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions -- 01/18/02"}, "input_fields": ["contents", "filename"], "generated_fields": ["sender", "subject"], "total_input_tokens": 6079.0, "total_output_tokens": 38.0, "total_input_cost": 0.015197500000000001, "total_output_cost": 0.00038, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 2.310997724533081, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": false, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "prompt_strategy": "PromptStrategy.DSPY_COT_QA", "image_conversion": "False", "inputSchema": "TextFile(contents, filename)", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "cardinality": "one-to-one", "udf": "None"}}, {"record_id": "940723163c", "record_parent_id": "1077939f41", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/martin-t-inbox-98-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "martin-t-inbox-98-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <28543449.1075841171541.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 18 Jan 2002 09:52:41 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nTo: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nSubject: Enron Mentions -- 01/18/02\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SPALME2>\nX-To: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spalme2>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Martin, Thomas A.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: MARTIN-T\nX-FileName: tom martin 6-25-02.PST\n\n\nEnron Letter Writer Worked At Key Partnership Early On\nDow Jones Energy Service, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron's Chief Sold Shares After Receiving Warning Letter\nThe New York Times, 01/18/2002\n\nA look at Thursday's developments involving Enron\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron fires Andersen=20\nBoard takes action as new facts surface=20\nHouston Chronicle, 01/18/2002\nIn Enron Leaders, Seeing the Worst Of Ourselves\nThe Washington Post, 01/18/2002\n\nBroadband-unit hype didn't match reality=20\nHouston Chronicle, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron chairman selling 2 homes, lot in Colorado for $16.2 million=20\nHouston Chronicle, 01/18/2002\n\nBlockbuster deal helped sow seeds of Enron fiasco CIBC World Markets agreed=\n to invest $115.2-million in affiliated partnership\nWall Street Journal,  01/18/2002\n\nDeals That Helped Doom Enron Began to Form in the Early 90's\nThe New York Times, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron deals that led to collapse began in early 1990s - report\nAFX News, 01/18/2002\n\nAndersen HQ 'discussed Enron purge'.\nFinancial Times, 01/18/2002\n\nAttorneys for Enron assure judge more documents won't be shredded\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nWhen Rules Keep Debt Off the Books --- Did Andersen Act Properly?

Skilling\n> resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its author was later\n> identified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for corporate\n> development at Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committee released\n> excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday:\n\n\n> Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't get\n> rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?\n> Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting\n> improprieties and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in its\n> accounting - most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor vehicle.\n> We do have valuation issues with our international assets and possibly\n> some of our EES MTM positions.\n> The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept that Skilling\nis\n> leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues can be fixed and\n> reported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002. How do we fix\n> the Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003, we will have\nto\n> pony up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed.\n> To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds flow\nof\n> $800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a vehicle\n> (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in later\nyears.\n> Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity issuance?\n> We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks via\nour\n> swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly - Avici\n> by 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power Company by\n> 80 percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the swaps won't\n> be there for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to offset these\n> losses. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the layman on the\nstreet\n> that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that\n> company with Enron stock in the future.\n> I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting\n> scandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on\nmy\n> r?sum?, the business world will consider the past successes as nothing\nbut\n> an elaborate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for \"personal\n> reasons\" but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down the road and\n> knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now than\n> resign in shame in two years.\n> Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I have\n> thought and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into one\n> big problem - we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and 2000, we\n> enjoyed wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold stock, we then\n> try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit like robbing the\n> bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later. Nice try, but\n> investors were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a share looking for $120\na\n> share and now they're at $38 or worse. We are under too much scrutiny and\n> there are probably one or two disgruntled \"redeployed\" employees who know\n> enough about the \"funny\" accounting to get us in trouble.\n> What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in the\n> all-employee meeting, but can you give some assurances that you and\nCausey\n> will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is going to\n> happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003?\n> Summary of Alleged Issues:\n>\n> RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at risk;\n> however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM.\n> If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is no\n> commitment to contribute more equity.\n> The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form of\n> Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.\n> Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptor\n> entities locking in our values for various equity investments we hold.\n> As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the\n> equity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying\n> securities.\n> This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying\n> capitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing\n> for reserves against our MTM positions.\n> To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we \"enhanced\"\n> the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing more ENE shares.\n> My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must \"enhance\"\n> the vehicles by $250 million.\n> I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and a\nlot\n> of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting treatment.\n> None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed\n> in the bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's problems of\nWaste\n> Management (news/quote\n>\n</redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custo\n> m/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=WMI>) - where AA paid $130 million\n> plus in litigation re questionable accounting practices.)\n> The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain the\n> \"accounting treatment\" to a man in the street, would you influence his\n> investing decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on a thorough\n> understanding of the facts? If so, you best present it correctly and/or\n> change the accounting.\n> My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the\n> transactions. If adequately explained, the investor would know that the\n> \"entities\" described in our related party footnote are thinly\ncapitalized,\n> the equity holders have no skin in the game, and all the value in the\n> entities comes from the underlying value of the derivatives\n(unfortunately\n> in this case, a big loss) AND Enron stock and N/P. Looking at the stock\nwe\n> swapped, I also don't believe any other company would have entered into\n> the equity derivative transactions with us at the same prices or without\n> substantial premiums from Enron. In other words, the $500 million in\n> revenue in 2000 would have been much lower. How much lower?\n> Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well, then no\n> one would be the wiser. If Enron stock did well, the stock issuance to\n> these entities would decline and the transactions would be less\n> noticeable. All has gone against us. The stocks, most notably Hanover,\nthe\n> New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser degrees.\n> I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a\n> clear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the\n> transactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities\nlaw\n> and accounting. I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for himself\n> what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the estimated\n> damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one of two\n> courses of action:\n> 1. The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated damage\ntoo\n> great; therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly reverse, unwind,\n> write down these positions/transactions.\n> 2. The probability of discovery is too great, the estimated damages to\nthe\n> company too great; therefore, we must quantify, develop damage\ncontainment\n> plans and disclose.\n> I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly\nincreased\n> with Skilling's shocking departure. Too many people are looking for a\n> smoking gun.\n> Summary of Raptor Oddities:\n> 1. The accounting treatment looks questionable.\n> a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a\nrelated\n> party.\n> b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk except\n> Enron.\n> c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a\n> contribution of its own shares.\n> One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in its\n> equity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I can't\n> find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who will\nlose\n> this money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party entity?\n> If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact\npattern\n> that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors.\n> 2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms length.\n> a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party at\n> what now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici have\n> fallen away significantly since. The related party was unable to lay off\n> this risk. This fact pattern is once again very negative for Enron.\n> b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into\nthese\n> transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was the\n> compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such\n> transactions?\n> 3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees question\n> our accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This alone is cause\n> for concern.\n> a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM. He\n> complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought\n> should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later,\n> Skilling offered him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Markets and\nnever\n> addressed the five steps with him.\n> b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen\n> about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM.\n> c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal investments\n> group say, \"I know it would be devastating to all of us, but I wish we\n> would get caught. We're such a crooked company.\" The principal\ninvestments\n> group hedged a large number of their investments with Raptor. These\npeople\n> know and see a lot. Many similar comments are made when you ask about\n> these deals. Employees quote our C.F.O. as saying that he has a handshake\n> deal with Skilling that LJM will never lose money.\n> 4. Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the money\n> trail between Enron and LJM/Raptor and its principals? Can he look at\nLJM?\n> At Raptor? If the C.F.O. says no, isn't that a problem?\n> Condor and Raptor Work:\n", "sender": "gregory.schockling@enron.com", "subject": "FW: E memo"}, "op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "logical_op_id": "a431944fa4", "op_name": "LLMConvertBonded", "time_per_record": 1.2213897705078125, "cost_per_record": 0.008855, "source_op_id": null, "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": {"sender": "gregory.schockling@enron.com", "subject": "FW: E memo"}, "input_fields": ["contents", "filename"], "generated_fields": ["sender", "subject"], "total_input_tokens": 3418.0, "total_output_tokens": 31.0, "total_input_cost": 0.008545, "total_output_cost": 0.00031, "filter_str": null, "passed_filter": null, "llm_call_duration_secs": 1.217668056488037, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": false, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "prompt_strategy": "PromptStrategy.DSPY_COT_QA", "image_conversion": "False", "inputSchema": "TextFile(contents, filename)", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "cardinality": "one-to-one", "udf": "None"}}, {"record_id": "0288ac8ab8", "record_parent_id": "a9cf45fb22", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/skilling-j-inbox-1109.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "skilling-j-inbox-1109.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <16177083.1075852671497.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 25 Sep 2001 15:39:29 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: gary@cioclub.com\nTo: jeff.skilling@enron.com\nSubject: Information Security Executive\n                                  -092501\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Gary@CIOClub.com@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-Gary+40CIOClub+2Ecom+40ENRON@ENRON.com>\nX-To: Skilling, Jeff </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JSKILLIN>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JSKILLIN (Non-Privileged)\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Dasovich-J\nX-FileName: JDASOVIC (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nDear Jeff,\n\nThis will introduce an outstanding Information Security Executive who is available in the near term through the CIO Club.\n\nExecutive Summary:\n15 years of management experience in the planning, design, development, and implementation  of information security policies, controls, services and  systems.

The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu.\nThe market dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the\nsession between $2.10 - $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as\nlocals sold down the contract to the $2.07 support level and went home\nshort. The AGA will release this week's storage report this afternoon, and\nwhile some traders are predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf\nwithdrawal, look for the number to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in\nthe Midwest and Texas, the growing differential between cash and futures,\nand the perceived premium in the early March contract have kept the market\nfrom dropping further. Physical prices retained their premium over futures\nyesterday on short-term cold weather at some pipelines, maintaining about\na $0.07 - $0.10 premium over the NYMEX. But cash traders expect the demand\nto ease quickly as temperatures moderate by this weekend. As usual, the\nmarket will look to the weekly storage report for short term direction,\nbut it is the massive amount of volumes still in storage compared to last\nyear that has put a cap on longer term price increases. Natural gas for\nnext day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to plus or\nminus a few cents yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the\nHenry hub gained $0.02 to $2.20 per MMBtu.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n Exploit the enterprise-wide transaction management power deployed by the\nbig names in gas.\nNUCLEUS Software\nZAINET Gasmaster\nThe most comprehensive, totally-integrated natural gas information system\navailable today.\nAsk about out limited-time offer competitive upgrade program.\nCAMINUS\nYour Competitive Edge in Energy.\nCall Caminus at (212)515-3700 or visit the website at\nhttp://www.caminus.com\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nToday's Power Bulletins\n * Ameren 4th Quarter Earnings Jump 19% as Increased Electricity Sales\nOffset Lower Prices\n * In Wake of Enron Collapse, Senate Energy Committee Takes 2nd Look at\nPublic Utility Holding Company Act at Hearing Today\n * California Senate Energy Committee's Plans Hearing on ISO's Market\nDesign Plan for 2002; Members Have Serious Doubts About ISO's Ability to\nEnforce Market Rules Going Forward\n * Allegheny Energy Files Shelf to Sell Up to $1.5 Billion in Common\nStock, Preferred Securities, Debt Securities, Warrants, Contracts, Units\nand Trusts\n * Unitil Cuts New Hampshire Electric Rates to Lowest in Region\n * El Paso Completes 172 MW Expansion of Linden NJ Power Plant\n * Centennial Power Acquires Rocky Mountain Power\n * Duke/Fluor Daniel to Build 875 MW Power Plant for South Carolina\nElectric & Gas\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nDO YOU JUST SEE TREES?

In\ntestimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that\nEnron had a $500 million loss in March. Rather than report it to\nshareholders, Enron gave a partnership called Raptor another $800 million\nin Enron shares. He said that there is no doubt that almost everyone, from\nthe board of directors on down, knew that the company was attempting to\noffset investment losses with stock. The partnerships allowed Enron to\nmisrepresent earnings for a period spanning the 3rd quarter of 2000\nthrough the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers told that committee\nthat over 70% of Enron's earnings for that period were false. He said that\nthere were red flags that should have alerted former chairman Ken Lay to\nwhat was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely understood that Enron\nwas using its own stock to offset the losses in the partnerships.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFAST.

This was a good price (average price LTM of 37p), but was below the quarter end price.  Therefore, there is a Q3 loss of $6.4 million.  Andrew Marsden is managing this in London.\nCompleted all requirements to sell COPEL shares (a $100+ million investment in the Brazilian utility).  Began selling shares on 7/17.  Current price is approximately $14 million below carrying value of approximately $120 million.  Likely to take a couple of months to exit entire position.  Investment is carried as \"Strategic\", and any losses upon the sale will fall \"below the line\" in the sale of non-merchant asset line.  Steven Sheldon is managing this.\nCompleted negotiations on the sale of Utiliquest for $62.5 million.  Should sign on Thursday.  Enron had invested $11.6 million in cash (net of JEDI II) and will receive $14.3 million.  The sale will net a cash gain to Enron, but below our carrying value of $16.3 million, yielding a $2 million accounting loss.  Kevin Kuykendall is managing this.\nFinalized processes to begin selling Hanover Compressor shares.  We own 4.6 million shares, which are trading at $30.00/share for a total value of $138 million.  Hanover has been hedged through Raptor.  However, the structure that was used to hedge is a costless collar that leaves Enron exposed below $34.875/share.  Therefore, at current trading levels we are facing a $23 million loss.  We are working with CSFB, which has proposed to execute a block trade sale.  However, the stock continues to decline each day, and CSFB will not make an offer until the price stabilizes.  If we have to sell at a block discount, or if the price continues to fall we could be facing a $35 million to $40 million loss.  Needless to say, we are very focused on this investment.\nLosses from Venture Capital positions appear to be approximately $10 million for Q3, which is primarily the result of write-offs in the HEOF portfolio.\nNet quarterly expectations: Cash proceeds received from sales - ~$250 million, losses from sales below carrying value ~$60 million ($46 million \"above the line\" and $14 million \"below the line\").  \n\nIntegration\nAll personnel decisions made.\nLegal (Gil Melman), RAC (Randy Petersen), accounting (Hope Vargas), HR (Sheila Walton) and Tax (Jim Sandt) support personnel determined.\nEveryone moving to same location (EB36) today.\nPreparation of 2nd half 2001 budget (revenue and expense) still in process.

Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, after Jeffrey K.\nSkilling resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its author\nwas later identified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for\ncorporate development at Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committee\nreleased excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday:\n\n   Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't\nget rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?\n   Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting\nimproprieties and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in\nits accounting -- most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor\nvehicle. We do have valuation issues with our international assets and\npossibly some of our EES MTM positions.\n\n   The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept that\nSkilling is leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues can\nbe fixed and reported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002.\nHow do we fix the Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003,\nwe will have to pony up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed.\n\n   To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds\nflow of $800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a\nvehicle (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in\nlater years. Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity\nissuance?\n\n   We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks\nvia our swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly\n-- Avici by 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power\nCompany by 80 percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the\nswaps won't be there for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to\noffset these losses. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the\nlayman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company and\nwill compensate that company with Enron stock in the future.\n\n   I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting\nscandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on\nmy resume, the business world will consider the past successes as\nnothing but an elaborate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for\n''personal reasons'' but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down\nthe road and knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship\nnow than resign in shame in two years.\n\n   Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I\nhave thought and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into\none big problem -- we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and\n2000, we enjoyed wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold\nstock, we then try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit\nlike robbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years\nlater. Nice try, but investors were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a\nshare looking for $120 a share and now they're at $38 or worse. We are\nunder too much scrutiny and there are probably one or two disgruntled\n''redeployed'' employees who know enough about the ''funny'' accounting\nto get us in trouble.\n\n   What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in the\nall-employee meeting, but can you give some assurances that you and\nCausey will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is\ngoing to happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003?\n\n   Summary of Alleged Issues:\n\n   RAPTOR  Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at\nrisk; however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid\nto LJM. If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is\nno commitment to contribute more equity.\n\n   The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some\nform of Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.\n\n   Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the\nRaptor entities locking in our values for various equity investments we\nhold.\n\n   As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the\nequity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying\nsecurities.\n\n   This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying\ncapitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing\nfor reserves against our MTM positions.\n\n   To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we\n''enhanced'' the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing\nmore ENE shares.\n\n   My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must\n''enhance'' the vehicles by $250 million.\n\n   I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and\na lot of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting\ntreatment. None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are\never disclosed in the bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's\nproblems of Waste Management -- where AA paid $130 million plus in\nlitigation re questionable accounting practices.)\n\n   The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain\nthe ''accounting treatment'' to a man in the street, would you influence\nhis investing decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on a\nthorough understanding of the facts? If so, you best present it\ncorrectly and/or change the accounting.\n\n   My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the\ntransactions. If adequately explained, the investor would know that the\n''entities'' described in our related party footnote are thinly\ncapitalized, the equity holders have no skin in the game, and all the\nvalue in the entities comes from the underlying value of the derivatives\n(unfortunately in this case, a big loss) AND Enron stock and N/P.\nLooking at the stock we swapped, I also don't believe any other company\nwould have entered into the equity derivative transactions with us at\nthe same prices or without substantial premiums from Enron. In other\nwords, the $500 million in revenue in 2000 would have been much lower.\nHow much lower?\n\n   Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well, then\nno one would be the wiser. If Enron stock did well, the stock issuance\nto these entities would decline and the transactions would be less\nnoticeable. All has gone against us. The stocks, most notably Hanover,\nthe New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser\ndegrees.\n\n   I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a\nclear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the\ntransactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities\nlaw and accounting. I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for\nhimself what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the\nestimated damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one\nof two courses of action:\n\n   1. The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated\ndamage too great; therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly\nreverse, unwind, write down these positions/transactions.\n\n   2. The probability of discovery is too great, the estimated damages\nto the company too great; therefore, we must quantify, develop damage\ncontainment plans and disclose.\n\n   I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly\nincreased with Skilling's shocking departure. Too many people are\nlooking for a smoking gun.\n\n   Summary of Raptor Oddities:\n\n   1. The accounting treatment looks questionable.\n\n   a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a\nrelated party.\n\n   b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk\nexcept Enron.\n\n   c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a\ncontribution of its own shares.\n\n   One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in\nits equity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I\ncan't find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who\nwill lose this money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party\nentity?\n\n   If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact\npattern that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors.\n\n   2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms\nlength.\n\n   a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party\nat what now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici\nhave fallen away significantly since. The related party was unable to\nlay off this risk. This fact pattern is once again very negative for\nEnron.\n\n   b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into\nthese transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was\nthe compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such\ntransactions?\n\n   3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees\nquestion our accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This\nalone is cause for concern.\n\n   a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM.\nHe complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he\nthought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days\nlater, Skilling offered him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Markets\nand never addressed the five steps with him.\n\n   b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would\nlisten about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM.\n\n   c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal\ninvestments group say, ''I know it would be devastating to all of us,\nbut I wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company.'' The\nprincipal investments group hedged a large number of their investments\nwith Raptor. These people know and see a lot. Many similar comments are\nmade when you ask about these deals. Employees quote our C.F.O. as\nsaying that he has a handshake deal with Skilling that LJM will never\nlose money.\n\n   4. Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the\nmoney trail between Enron and LJM/Raptor and its principals? Can he look\nat LJM? At Raptor? If the C.F.O. says no, isn't that a problem?\n\n   Condor and Raptor Work:\n\n   1. Postpone decision on filling office of the chair, if the current\ndecision includes C.F.O. and/or C.A.O.\n\n   2. Involve Jim Derrick and Rex Rogers to hire a law firm to\ninvestigate the Condor and Raptor transactions to give Enron\nattorney-client privilege on the work product. (Can't use V & E due to\nconflict -- they provided some true sale opinions on some of the deals).\n\n   3. Law firm to hire one of the big 6, but not Arthur Andersen or\nPricewaterhouseCoopers due to their conflicts of interest: AA & Co.\n(Enron); PWC (LJM).\n\n   4. Investigate the transactions, our accounting treatment and our\nfuture commitments to these vehicles in the form of stock, NP, etc., For\ninstance: In the third quarter we have a $250 million problem with\nRaptor 3 (NPW) if we don't ''enhance'' the capital structure of Raptor 3\nto commit more ENE shares. By the way: in Q. 1 we enhanced the Raptor 3\n", "sender": "dan.dorland@enron.com", "subject": "FW: Text of Letter to Enron's Chairman After Departure of Chief Executive"}, "op_id": "0e91c184ef", "logical_op_id": "ce36d58df1", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 1.7428350448608398, "cost_per_record": 0.009172500000000002, "source_op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": "FALSE", "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 3149, "total_output_tokens": 130, "total_input_cost": 0.007872500000000001, "total_output_cost": 0.0013000000000000002, "filter_str": "The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron", "passed_filter": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 1.7397818565368652, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "filter": "Filter(The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron)"}}, {"record_id": "ed5a38ede3", "record_parent_id": "2970a59bfb", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/kaminski-v-deleted-items-1902.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "kaminski-v-deleted-items-1902.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <19381926.1075862452297.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Mon, 26 Nov 2001 17:36:38 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: vkaminski@aol.com\nTo: vkamins@enron.com\nSubject: Fwd: FYI\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: VKaminski@aol.com@ENRON\nX-To: vkamins@enron.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\VKAMINS (Non-Privileged)\\Kaminski, Vince J\\Deleted Items\nX-Origin: Kaminski-V\nX-FileName: VKAMINS (Non-Privileged).pst\n\n\n\nReturn-Path: <J_Martin@baylor.edu>\nReceived: from  rly-yb03.mx.aol.com (rly-yb03.mail.aol.com [172.18.146.3]) by air-yb02.mail.aol.com (v82.22) with ESMTP id MAILINYB27-1126123929; Mon, 26 Nov 2001 12:39:29 -0500\nReceived: from  FS-EXCHANGE1.baylor.edu (mopsy.baylor.edu [129.62.3.249]) by rly-yb03.mx.aol.com (v82.22) with ESMTP id MAILRELAYINYB36-1126123856; Mon, 26 Nov 2001 12:38:56 -0500\ncontent-class: urn:content-classes:message\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative;\tboundary=\"----_=_NextPart_001_01C176A1.18D3DF49\"\nSubject: FYI\nX-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft Exchange V6.0.4712.0\nDate: Mon, 26 Nov 2001 11:38:02 -0600\nMessage-ID: <5E74244E8258EE45A18E795A5B0B8CB484B1B8@FS-EXCHANGE1.baylor.edu>\nX-MS-Has-Attach:\nX-MS-TNEF-Correlator:\nThread-Topic: \"Oh, the Games Enron Played\" (from the Knowledge@Wharton website)...\nThread-Index: AcF2menu5I9zmzM5Rq6Sf8X9AngbPwABxYnQ\nFrom: \"Martin, John D.\" <J_Martin@baylor.edu>\nTo: \"David Martin (E-mail)\" <dmartin@imperialcapital.com>,        \"Vince Kaminski (E-mail)\" <vkaminski@aol.com>\nX-Mailer: Unknown (No Version)\n\n\n \n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Garven, James R.  \nSent: Monday, November 26, 2001 10:47 AM\nTo: Martin, John  D.\nSubject: FYI: \"Oh, the Games Enron Played\" (from the  Knowledge@Wharton website)...\nOh, the Games Enron Played \nIn the 1990s, Houston's Enron Corp. was Wall Street's darling. It had  thrown out the energy-industry playbook, remaking itself from a staid gas  pipeline company to a high-tech trading firm that created exotic securities for  betting on everything from gas prices to the number of hot days in  summer.\nShare prices soared from $30 to $90 between 1998 and 2000, as  sales increased from $31 billion to more than $100 billion. Enron executives  gained reputations as the energy industry's visionaries.\nThis fall it all  came apart. Share prices have fallen by 90% this year, including a plunge from  just below $40 to less than $10 this fall. In October, Enron reported a  third-quarter loss of $618 million. The company's massive debt was downgraded to  near junk-bond status, and the CEO and CFO were expelled. Shareholders sued and  the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an  investigation.\nFinally, the humiliated company, which employs more than  20,000, agreed Nov. 9 to be taken over by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc.  for about $9 billion in stock and $13 billion in assumed debt. It is not certain  the merger will take place since it is subject to regulatory approval and could  be blocked on antitrust grounds. And some news accounts suggest that major  Dynegy shareholders could derail the merger over concerns about inheriting  liabilities from current or future lawsuits by Enron shareholders.\nThe  Enron story is not simply a case of a lone company that played with fire and got  burned. Enron was able to take enormous risks while keeping shareholders in the  dark because it could exploit accounting loopholes for subsidiaries that are  available to most publicly traded companies. Companies like Enron can legally  conceal massive debts because rules require a full accounting of a subsidiary's  balance sheet only when the parent company owns more than half of it.\n\"If  I'm a shareholder of Enron and I want full and fair disclosure, I would want  information about the entities Enron controls,\" says Wharton accounting  professor Robert E. Verrecchia. Yet Enron shareholders have never received such  a report.\nEnron's fate is crucial to the energy industry and other  markets it serves, points out Paul R. Kleindorfer, a professor of public policy  and an expert on deregulation at Wharton. Producers and users of gas, oil,  electricity and other forms of energy rely on Enron's system for trading  futures, forwards, options, swaps and other contracts to get the best prices and  control costs far into the future. Without such a system, deregulation simply  cannot work.\n\"If Enron's trading platform were to go down it would not be  a minor loss,\" Kleindorfer says. \"It would be a huge loss for the industry?.In  the early 1990s the company single-handedly produced the backbone infrastructure  that has led to a whole industry of broker intermediation.\"\nTo some  extent, Enron appears to have been a victim of sagging securities prices and  volatile energy costs in 2000 and 2001, and it has lost hundreds of millions by  laying fiber-optic cable for which there is no demand. But although those  factors may have determined the timing of the company's troubles, they were not  the chief cause. Enron appears to have lost enormous amounts of shareholder  money by gambling at its own roulette wheels.\n\"In hindsight, we made some  very bad investments in non-core businesses that performed worse than we ever  could have conceived,\" Chairman Kenneth Lay told analysts last week.\nHow  did Enron get into this mess?\nBecoming a Market Maker\nWhen  it was created in 1985 by the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth,  parent company of Northern Natural Gas, Enron's chief business was the operation  of thousands of miles of natural gas pipeline. Lay became chairman in Feb. 1986.  Then early in the 1990s, the federal government took key steps to deregulate the  energy industry.\nPreviously, large regulated utilities were vertically  integrated, giving them control from wellhead to consumer, Kleindorfer says.  Deregulation effectively broke apart the production, long-range transmission and  local distribution functions, leaving each to a different set of players. A  factory owner, for example, can now buy gas or electricity from number of  producers.\nTo function, a free market such as this needs brokers, or  intermediaries, to create, buy and sell contracts for production and delivery,  and it requires a market maker to facilitate trading, just as the big Wall  Street firms and exchanges facilitate trading in stocks. Enron created that  marketplace. \"This intermediation activity, or brokerage activity, just  revolutionized the marketplace,\" Kleindorfer says.\nSince utilities and  other energy users must line up dependable supplies for many months in the  future, they rely on various forms of contracts specifying quantities, prices  and delivery dates. But before the commodity is delivered, prevailing prices may  go up or down, and a supplier may find it has promised to sell at a price that's  now too low, while a purchaser may find that it could have bought for less than  it had agreed to pay.\nSuppliers and purchasers therefore use a variety of  derivative contracts to benefit from prices that move in their favor and hedge  in case prices move against them. A company that has contracted to buy a  shipload of liquefied natural gas at a specific price in three months, could,  for a much smaller sum, buy an options contract giving it the right, but not the  obligation, to buy a shipload at a lower price. And it could buy an option  giving it the right to sell at a higher price. Thus it is protected regardless  of whether prices move up or down.\nThis was the business Enron invented.  By permitting competition and price discovery far into the future, it brought to  the marketplace the most efficient pricing and allowed energy users to predict  and stabilize costs far into the future, Kleindorfer says. \"Having that  information historically, as well as projected into the future, could  revolutionize how you plan your business,\" he said. \nAt the heart of  Enron's business strategy was the belief that it could be a big energy player  without owning all the power plants, ships, pipelines and other facilities  involved. Instead, it could use contracts to control the facilities in which  other companies had invested, says Ehud Ronn, director of the Center for Energy  Finance Education and Research at the Red McCombs School of Business at the  University of Texas at Austin. The Center trains masters candidates in the use  of energy securities. (Enron is one of the center's eight corporate  sponsors.)\nEnron, he says, evolved into something akin to a Wall Street  firm. \"Enron thought of itself in very similar terms as an investment banker  that wanted to tie up as little capital as possible.\"\nBy 2001, Enron had  evolved into a market maker for some 1,800 different products, many of them  energy- or Internet-related contracts or derivatives the company had created  itself. They included products allowing customers to buy, sell, hedge or  speculate in markets ranging from traditional commodities like coal, oil, gas  and electricity to cutting edge markets for Internet bandwidth, pollution  emissions, semiconductors, wind energy and many others. Prices for many of these  products were available on the company's free website, giving the energy markets  unprecedented price transparency.\nBetting on the Weather\nTo  see how these products could be used, consider one of Enron's \"weather risk  management\" products meant for utilities, energy distributors, agricultural  companies and financial institutions. A gas utility, for example, might use a  \"floor\" to protect its revenue in the event of a mild winter. In exchange for a  premium similar to that paid on an insurance policy, Enron will compensate the  utility for every day between November and March on which the temperature rises  above a set level. The payments would make up for reduced gas sales.\nIn  another form of contract called a swap, or collar, Enron will pay the gas  company a given amount if the number of warm days exceeds a set level. But if  the number of cold days exceeds a threshold, the gas company will make a  payment to Enron. The utility would not have to pay a premium as it would with  the floor, and if it had to pay Enron, the money would come from the extra  revenue received by selling more gas in a colder-than normal winter.\nTo a  layman this might look like betting. \"We never use that word,\" says Ronn. \"The  worst we say is to 'have a view.'\"\nIn practice, other parties are often  involved in such transactions, taking over the contractual obligation created by  Enron. So, in addition to placing its own bets, Enron serves as a middleman, the  way a stockbroker stands in the middle of a securities trade.\nLike many  middlemen, Enron has to be in a position to make good on any transaction should  either party default. Otherwise, it would be hard to make a market in these  products. In addition, says Ronn, Enron often has to pay out money before  receiving payment from another party. Finally, Enron needed large amounts of  capital to trade products in its own account, just as a Wall Street firm invests  in stocks on its own in addition to executing customers' trades. To accomplish  all this, Enron needed vast amounts of capital. \"You do need to have liquidity  in huge numbers,\" Ronn says.\nThis created a dilemma. A public company can  raise capital by selling additional shares, but current shareholders don't like  that because the new shares dilute the value of their holdings. The alternative  is to borrow, but large debts hurt a company's credit rating, forcing it to pay  higher interest rates on its loans.\nAndrew S. Fastow, who became the  company's senior vice president of finance in 1990, found innovative ways to  issue new shares without dilution and to raise capital by selling old-fashioned  assets like power plants and pipelines.\n\"He has invented a groundbreaking  strategy,\" Ted. A. Izatt, senior vice president at Lehman Brother's Inc., told  CFO Magazine in the fall of 1999. Or, as Enron president and CEO Jeffrey  K. Skilling told the magazine: \"We needed someone to rethink the entire  financing structure at Enron from soup to nuts. We didn't want someone stuck in  the past, since the industry of yesterday is no longer. Andy has the  intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways. He deserves every  accolade tossed his way.\"\nFastow, named chief financial officer in March  1998, told the magazine: \"We transformed finance into a merchant  organization?.Essentially, we would buy and sell risk positions.\" A key to the  strategy: Move many of Enron's transactions \"off the balance sheet.\" In part,  this involved exploiting a loophole in the securities and accounting  regulations. As noted earlier, debts accumulated by subsidiaries, partnerships  or other \"entities\" can be kept off the parent company's books so long as the  parent does not own more than 50% of the entity incurring the debt.\nBy  using so-called unconsolidated subsidiaries, \"you do not make transparent either  the nature of the investment or the relationship between the parent and the  subsidiary,\" said Verrecchia. Heavy hitters such as Wall Street analysts and  major shareholders may have the clout to get a company to provide additional  information on subsidiaries. \"But if you're just an investor picking up Enron's  annual report, you are stuck,\" Verrecchia added.\nA Pattern of Sketchy  Details \nIt has long been clear from company statements and SEC  filings that Enron's off-balance-sheet transactions were enormous, but details  were sketchy because Enron did not have to report them, and chose not to. By  this fall, however, it became obvious these transactions involved huge risks  when Enron acknowledged it had improperly kept some activity off its books.  Putting those debts and losses into Enron's financial statements last month  meant reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. Corrected statements reduced  net income by $96 million for 1997, $113 million for 1998, $250 million for 1999  and $132 million for 2000.\nAt issue were so-called \"special purpose  entities,\" or SPEs, set up for a variety of transactions for Enron's benefit.  Enron conceded some of these entities did not meet the accounting standards to  be kept off of Enron's books. In one case, for instance, the entity had  \"inadequate capitalization\" for such treatment.\nIn 2000, Enron had  created four entities known as Raptor I, II, III and IV to \"hedge market risk in  certain of its investments,\" according to an Enron filing with the SEC. Enron  acquired notes receivable from the Raptors in exchange for an obligation to  issue Enron shares to the entities. But Enron had improperly included the value  of the notes receivable on its books without accounting for the cost of the  shares it would have to issue. In correcting this violation of accounting rules,  Enron said it had overstated its shareholders equity by $1 billion in March and  June 2001.\nEnron was particularly embarrassed in acknowledging that two  special purpose entities, limited partnerships LJM Cayman and LJM Co-Investment,  had Fastow as the managing partner. Fastow, who according to Enron made in  excess of $30 million in this role, was forced out of the company in October. An  internal committee and the SEC are investigating the use of the  partnerships.\nObviously, Fastow's role was a problem. If the partnerships  were truly independent entities, he was in a conflict of interest. If he was  running them on Enron's behalf, they were not independent.\nDespite the  write-downs and disclosures this fall, many analysts complain they still do not  have a full picture of Enron's activities. Enron, for instance, has not fully  described other partnerships it believes it can properly keep off the balance  sheet. Nor is it clear to what extent Enron's losses are due to bad bets it had  made through highly-leveraged derivatives. While a stock market investor can  simply hang on to shares to wait out a downturn, options and other derivatives  typically have expiration dates. If the bet has not turned out as hoped, the  entire investment can be lost.\n\"New disclosure was modest and management  did not resolve concerns,\" Goldman Sachs analysts David Maccarrone and David  Fleischer wrote in an Oct. 24 report to clients. Though Enron had long faced  such criticisms, investors had tended to give the company the benefit of the  doubt \"because of its strong growth in earnings and acknowledged industry  leading capabilities?,\" the two analysts said.\nIn other words, when stock  was soaring, investors didn't require details on how it was done. Now they are  crying foul, and a number of shareholder suits have been filed. Essentially,  they claim the company inflated its stock price by filing false financial  statements. Investors who bought shares at those high prices have suffered huge  losses.\nFor years, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets  accounting rules, has had a draft proposal for improving disclosure of  subsidiaries' activities and numbers. Essentially, it would move toward a more  qualitative evaluation of whether the parent controlled the subsidiary even if  it owned less than 50% of the stock. Control could be exerted by holding board  seats or through contracts that effectively make the subsidiary a unit of the  parent.\n\"What the FASB has promulgated seems to me to be sensible,\"  Verrecchia said, noting that the whole purpose of accounting is to give an  accurate view of a company's inner workings and true earnings.

Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith in Los Angeles and Robin Sidel and Jonathan Weil in New York\n\n11/09/2001\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA3\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nEnron Corp. reduced its previously reported net income dating back to 1997 by $586 million, or 20%, mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings with partnerships run by some company officers. \nThe disclosure, contained in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, came even as the Houston energy-trading company continued its merger talks with rival Dynegy Inc. Dynegy, an independent power producer and utility owner, is looking at acquiring Enron for roughly $7 billion to $8 billion, people familiar with the talks say. However, those talks could also be influenced by whether Enron is further downgraded by major credit-ratings agencies.\nThe total price being discussed would equate to about $10 an Enron share, barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Enron shares were down 7.1%, or 64 cents, to $8.41, a tenth of their 52-week high of $84.875. \nOn the Big Board, Dynegy traded at $36.50, up $3.50. Shares of several energy-trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the California state government pay an estimated $1.6 billion for past power purchases. \nIn yesterday's SEC filing, Enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets, debt and shareholder equity back to 1997. For instance, for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, Enron lopped about $2.2 billion, or 19%, off shareholder equity, reducing it to a total of $9.5 billion. Previously, the company had disclosed a reduction of only $1.2 billion. \nThe filing also said that Enron discharged Ben Glisan, the company treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of Enron's North America unit, in connection with investments they made in one of the officer-run limited partnerships. Until yesterday, Enron had insisted that Mr. Glisan wasn't associated with the officer-run partnerships. The company wouldn't explain why the the two had been discharged, and Mr. Glisan and Ms. Mordaunt couldn't be reached to comment. \nThe SEC filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation's biggest energy-trading company during the past month. During that time, Enron has reported a big third-quarter loss, the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships, and an SEC investigation. \nThe SEC filing raises further questions about Enron's accounting procedures and disclosure policies. Concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts, including those at major credit-rating agencies. The agencies downgraded Enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for further downgrades. \nRalph Pellecchia, credit analyst for Fitch, said he couldn't predict what effect the SEC filing would have on Enron's credit rating, but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures. \"It's bad,\" he said. \nThe Enron SEC filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, which reviewed the company's annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals. Because of all the accounting adjustments \"the audit reports covering the year-end financial statements for 1997-2000 should not be relied upon,\" yesterday's SEC filing said. \nAn Andersen spokesman called Enron's restatement announcement \"an unfortunate situation\" but said the accounting firm is \"cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters.\" He said he couldn't comment further because of client-confidentiality concerns. \nAmong the accounting turnabouts, Enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to Michael \nKopper, a former managing director of the company's North America unit. The two partnerships were known as Joint Energy Development Investments LP, or JEDI, and Chewco Investments LP. \nAs reported, Mr. Kopper managed the general partner of Chewco, which was formed in 1997. JEDI had been formed in 1993 by Enron in partnership with the huge California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers. \nIn 1997 Enron, which operated JEDI, bought out Calpers' interest for $383 million and immediately sold it to Chewco, according to the SEC filing. Almost all the money for Chewco's purchase came in loans from JEDI and an unnamed financial institution, whose loan was guaranteed by Enron. \nBy having a supposed outside party in the form of Chewco as a partner, Enron treated JEDI as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet. Enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both JEDI and Chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997. Taking that step retroactively resulted in a $396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000, the SEC filing said. \nMr. Kopper, who left Enron in July to run the partnerships, didn't return a phone call seeking comment. In the past, he has declined to be interviewed. \nEnron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called LJM Cayman LP. That consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $103 million. \nLJM and a similar but much larger partnership, called LJM2 Co-Investment LP, were formed in 1999 by Enron's then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who was replaced last month. The two partnerships were run by Mr. Fastow and Mr. Kopper, according to the Enron SEC filing and private partnership documents. Enron's SEC filing said the company believes that Mr. Fastow sold his interests in the LJM partnerships in July to Mr. Kopper. Mr. Fastow has declined to be interviewed. \nSeveral analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger LJM2 partnership. Some also pointed to a sentence in the SEC filing that said \"it is possible\" that continuing Enron reviews will \"identify additional or different information concerning these matters.\" \nAs such, \"there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the closet,\" said Brian Youngberg, energy analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. \nThe Enron SEC filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the LJM partnerships. Since 1999, those transactions produced $577.8 million in pretax earnings, despite a $711 million pretax charge in this year's third quarter due to the termination of deals with several LJM2-related entities. The filing also estimated that Mr. Fastow received more than $30 million from the LJM partnerships. \n--- Mea Culpa\n\nIn the midst of talks to be acquired by Dynegy, Enron details\naccounting and other actions.\n\n-- Will restate its financial results from 1997 through the third\nquarter of 2001, reducing previously reported income by $586 million\nand boosting previously reported debt to $628 million at the end of\n2000\n\n-- Concedes three entities run by company officials should have been\nincluded in its consolidated financial statements, based on generally\naccepted accounting principles\n\n-- Fires Ben Glisan, managing director and treasurer, and Kristina\nMordaunt, managing director and general counsel of an Enron division\n\n-- Establishes a special committee to review all transactions\n\nSource: the company\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It Doesn't Act Like It\nBy FLOYD NORRIS\n\n11/09/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 1, Column 2\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\n\nYOU'D be better informed if, instead of listening to what we say, you watch what we do.'' \nThat excellent advice was not issued by Enron management, although it should have been. Instead it came more than 30 years ago from John N. Mitchell, President Richard M. Nixon's attorney general.\nEnron's restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company's many strange transactions with related parties. It is now consolidating the results of some of its off-balance-sheet creations, though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery. \nBut the restatement should, at the least, cause investors and Wall Street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so-called pro forma earnings, which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules. \nIn January, Enron told investors its ''recurring net income,'' as it calls its pro forma number, would be $1.70 to $1.75 a share this year. The company's share price rose to $82 when that forecast was made. \nRemarkably, Enron is still on course to hit that target. Yesterday's restatement raised its nine-month earnings figure by a penny, to $1.36. And yet Enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $10 a share, or less than six times its reported profits, which still appear to be growing. Why so little? \nThe answer may be that Enron's board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance. Enron's failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring. And Enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid. So it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago. Don't call it a takeover. Takeunder would be a better term. \nWhat set off Enron's collapse? It now appears to have been a mistake. Enron says it added $1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error. The mistake did nothing to improve Enron's profits at the time, so it seems unlikely it was deliberate. Had the mistake not been made, the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $200 million, not $1.2 billion. That reduction scared investors into believing that Enron's transactions with partnerships led by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, had been disastrous for the company. Now it appears they may not have been so bad. \nBut that fact is not very important now. Enron's new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the Fastow partnerships. Such profits may be legal under accounting rules, but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are. \nIn fact, the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that may be important to Enron. The body charged with dealing with new accounting issues got a rush question on Oct. 23 -- the day before Enron ousted Mr. Fastow -- about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical ''Big Energy Corporation'' where one subsidiary, a natural gas pipeline company, trades with another subsidiary, an energy trading entity. The question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one. That company may or may not be Enron. \nSuch games will not work anymore, at least for Enron. It needs to be acquired because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers.\n\nGraph shows Enron share prices since Oct. 15. \nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Each embodied a sharply different approach to making money, attracting investors and winning over regulators.\nEnron thrived on risk, hurling itself into projects and businesses largely untested by others, earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of its murky accounting. \nDynegy is the slower, more cautious company, the younger sibling that carefully gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher Enron. Dynegy's steady progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibillion-dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor. \nAs one senior energy industry executive said, ''Enron's trying to hit more triples and home runs, while Dynegy tries for singles and doubles.'' \nKenneth Lay, the Enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies -- and whose influential friends include President Bush -- is the one who points to the bleachers. Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, Charles L. Watson, is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts. He also started small, nurturing his energy trading and generating company -- which had $33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended Sept. 30 -- from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid-80's. \nWhen electricity markets around the United States were deregulated, the companies followed clearly divergent paths. Utilities no longer necessarily generated power, and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity. Enron and Dynegy traded and marketed energy. Yet Enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power, a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast. \nDynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy. It cashed in, too, on deregulation, but not as Enron had. It stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations, retail power marketing, a water business and a broadband venture, most of which have gone badly awry. \nMr. Watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced. ''We need a little bit everywhere,'' he said. ''Enron is a financial player, but Dynegy is more of a physical player.'' \nIf Enron's finances grew more confusing, Dynegy seemed to offer clarity. If Enron promised a lot, analysts said, Dynegy played up its accomplishments. Enron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly, while Dynegy kept things quiet and discreet. \n''Chuck Watson is a pretty straight-talking guy,'' said Christopher R. Ellinghaus, a Williams Capital Group analyst. \nBecause Enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill, some analysts said, it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creative accounting. While Dynegy avoided such a path, no one really expects Mr. Watson to gloat about his company's new, larger stature. Enron may have been less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine, and it is unclear who will take on that role now. \n''Dynegy had what could be called a second-mover advantage,'' said Andre Meade, head of Commerzbank Securities' United States utility research. ''It seemed to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in Houston, Enron, go into a market. And if it was successful, Dynegy then could go in with less money and make it work.''\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN\n\n11/09/2001\nThe New York Times\nPage 1, Column 2\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\n\nThe Enron Corporation yesterday sliced more than half a billion dollars from its reported profits over the last five years, but its crosstown rival, Dynegy Inc., still appeared to be willing to acquire Enron, executives close to the merger talks said. \nWorries about how bond rating agencies would react to the merger delayed announcement of the deal, the executives said. But the failure to announce a deal -- as well as the profit restatement -- caused Enron's share price to fall. And volume in its core North American natural gas and electricity trading operation plunged 20 percent as other energy-trading companies, unnerved by Enron's financial distress, steered business elsewhere.\nThe boards of the two companies tentatively agreed late Wednesday night to a deal in which Dynegy would acquire Enron for about $8 billion in stock, or roughly $10 a share. \nThe deal would include an initial $1.5 billion cash infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent of Dynegy, and later an additional infusion of $1 billion. \nThe sticking point to proceeding with the deal, according to the executives, is whether Enron's credit rating will be reduced to ''junk'' status by the major credit rating agencies in reaction to Enron's disclosures and its plan to be acquired by Dynegy. \nDynegy and Enron have provided pro forma statements of what a combined Dynegy-Enron would look like and asked Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service for an ''expedited review'' of the transaction. \nDynegy and ChevronTexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a bigger cash infusion to buoy Enron's credit rating -- now just two notches from falling below investment grade -- if the agencies look askance at the current deal. The companies are hoping for a response within the next day or two, the executives said. \nThe executives also said Dynegy was seeking further protections that would allow it to back out of the deal if new, adverse disclosures surfaced. \nShares of Dynegy rose sharply yesterday, although it was not clear whether buyers believed that the company -- one-quarter the size of Enron, in terms of revenues -- was getting a bargain or that Enron's latest disclosures would lead to the deal's being abandoned. Dynegy rose $3.50, or 10.6 percent, to $36.50, gaining back all of the ground lost on Wednesday after news of the deal leaked. Enron shares fell 64 cents, or 7.1 percent, to $8.41. Less than a year ago, Enron traded for more than $84 a share, and the company was valued at nearly $70 billion. \nIn a sweeping restatement of its profits, Enron said that its actual net income for the years 1997 to 2000 was $591 million less than it had reported on its financial statements. In a filing with the S.E.C., Enron also indicated that part of last year's reported profits came from transactions with partnerships controlled by Andrew S. Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was ousted Oct. 24. \nEnron said the transactions involving Mr. Fastow, which are part of the S.E.C. investigation, earned the former executive more than $30 million. The company also said it had fired its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions, who both had invested in one of the partnerships. \nAny deal would also face long and complex reviews by federal and state energy regulators, who would have to sort out a range of competitive issues in the still-young business of wholesale natural gas and electricity trading. Among the agencies involved would be the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. \nSome analysts expressed hope that Enron's financial straits would encourage regulators to clear any deal, to relieve government officials of the prospect of dealing with the potential collapse of the nation's dominant energy-trading company. Enron handles about a quarter of all power trading, and higher proportions in some important regional markets. \n''If not for the dire condition of Enron today, we are not certain an Enron-Dynegy merger would be possible due to antitrust concerns,'' said Christopher R. Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital. ''However, the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the F.T.C., and would probably be looked at with some relief by the F.E.R.C.'' \nIt was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal. ''If Dynegy and Enron were to get together, obviously the thing that would appeal to Dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities, and that in itself would provide greater market power, not less market power,'' said Raymond Plank, chairman of the Apache Corporation, one of the largest independent natural gas producers, based in Houston. \nMr. Plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal. ''The thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility, and as a result, once again is threatening North American gas producers.'' \nEnron's restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997, and reduced it for every year since. But the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $5 million. \nThe changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent -- companies called Jedi and Chewco, after characters in the ''Star Wars'' movies -- and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called LJM1. That partnership, and another called LJM2, were run by Mr. Fastow. \nThe remainder of the earnings reductions, totaling $92 million from 1997 through 2000, came from what Enron called ''prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications,'' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditors, but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial. Details of those charges were not disclosed, and Enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions. \n''This is an unfortunate situation,'' said David Tabolt, a spokesman for Arthur Andersen, which audited Enron's books in all the years in question. ''Issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on Enron's financial statements or our audit reports. We are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters.'' \nWhile the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the LJM1 subsidiary, they did not fold the entire LJM1 partnership or the LJM2 partnership into Enron's financials. It is not clear how those partnerships performed. Nor did they include some other related entities whose Enron-guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors. \nMr. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, could not be reached for comment, his lawyer said. \nEnron's downward cascade began after it reported third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16. Its share price rose 67 cents, to $33.84, that day, as the company said its ''recurring net income'' had met analyst expectations, even though write-offs led to a net loss. \nIn a conference call that day, Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the LJM partnerships. In the following days, that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement. \nBut Enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $200 million, with the remaining $1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year. \nEnron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the LJM partnerships and assure they were proper. ''Whether these controls were properly implemented'' is being investigated by the special board committee, the company said. That committee has retained William McLucas, a former director of enforcement for the S.E.C., as well as accountants from Deloitte & Touche. \nThe company had disclosed that Mr. Fastow was involved with the LJM partnerships, but it had not reported that any other Enron officials were involved. Yesterday it said that three officers of the company, as well as another employee, had invested in an LJM1 subsidiary in March 2000. The officers were Ben Glisen, the company's treasurer; Kristina Mordaunt, the general counsel of an Enron division; and Kathy Lynn, vice president of an Enron division. The company said Ms. Lynn no longer worked for Enron and that the company was ''terminating the employment'' of the other two. \nSome industry officials said yesterday that a deal with Dynegy was increasingly looking like a do-or-die prospect for Enron, as other energy-trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies. While Enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets, by far its most valuable franchise is its energy-trading business in North America, which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company. \nYesterday, volume in that business dropped 20 percent. An Enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the S.E.C. investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with Dynegy. \nEnron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in Houston, executives said.

I wasn't trying to be critical of anyone specifically, and I think Dick is doing an admirable job.  I will give him high marks at PRC.  However, one position that has lost a significant amount of value since we were free to sell it is Avici.  Do you think that at PRC, this \"loss\" of value, which does not show up in a P/L since it is hedged by Raptor, should be taken into account when we evaluate the person?  My point is only that each of these investments are \"positions\" that should be \"owned\" by someone, like a book.  Hickerson didn't get evaluated on Avici because it didn't show up in a P/L (even though he lost a lot of value).  What do we do with Garland?  Now it has lost a lot of value again.  If Dick could sell an asset for a 10% loss today, but doesn't, and we eventually lose 30% upon disposition, how do you evaluate the performance?\n\nAndy  \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLavorato, John  \nSent:\tTuesday, April 03, 2001 11:09 AM\nTo:\tFastow, Andrew S.\nCc:\tKitchen, Louise\nSubject:\t\n\nAndy\n\nWith respect to North America, Dick Lydecker is liquidating most of the raptor assets.

Emshwiller and Kathryn Kranhold\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\n\n01/16/2002\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA4\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nA now highly publicized August 2001 letter from an Enron Corp. executive ra=\nising serious questions about the company's business and accounting practic=\nes was actually one of the later shots fired in an internal struggle that h=\nad been going on inside the energy-trading company for a year or more.=20\nThe letter to Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay from S=\nherron Watkins, a company vice president, detailed what she saw as the huge=\n financial and public-relations risks facing the company. Extensive dealing=\ns with partnerships that had been set up and run by some of the company's o=\nwn executives could cause Enron to \"implode,\" she wrote. Widespread disclos=\nure of those partnerships in the media beginning in October played a key ro=\nle in a collapse in investor confidence that eventually forced Enron to see=\nk bankruptcy-law protection.\nMs. Watkins's attorney, Philip Hilder, declined to discuss details of the l=\netter. But he said his client likely would cooperate with some of the gover=\nnment investigations into the Enron collapse. \"She has a compelling story a=\nnd I expect she'll have an opportunity to tell that story,\" Mr. Hilder said=\n.=20\nBut the story behind Ms. Watkins's letter is much more than that. It involv=\nes a power struggle over the direction of Enron as it committed itself to t=\nhe extremely unusual and tangled partnership structures that eventually con=\ntributed to its undoing. People familiar with that struggle say the issues =\nranged from the ethics of Enron's actions to a battle for the job of chief =\nfinancial officer at the Houston-based energy-trading company. The partners=\nhips -- called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP -- were formed in 19=\n99 by then Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who also ran the entities=\n and owned part of them. From the beginning, Mr. Fastow, Mr. Lay and other =\ntop company officials said the LJM partnerships were designed to do busines=\ns deals with Enron and help the energy company manage its financial risk.=\n=20\nHowever, other Enron officials were extremely skeptical about the partnersh=\nips, say company insiders and others familiar with the matter. For one thin=\ng, they saw inherent conflicts of interest in having the company's chief fi=\nnancial officer standing to financially benefit from business deals done wi=\nth Enron by an outside partnership that he headed. Late last year, Enron es=\ntimated that Mr. Fastow made more than $30 million from the LJM partnership=\ns.=20\nOne of the chief critics was Jeffrey McMahon, who in March 2000 took his co=\nncerns about LJM to then Enron President Jeffrey Skilling. Mr. Skilling did=\nn't share those concerns and soon after the meeting Mr. McMahon left his jo=\nb as corporate treasurer for another executive post within Enron.=20\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling says Mr. McMahon merely voiced worry about w=\nhether his own compensation might be affected if he had to negotiate deals =\non the opposite side of the table from LJM. Mr. McMahon \"never raised any b=\nroader concerns,\" she said.=20\n", "sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions (Part I) -- 01/16/02"}, "op_id": "0e91c184ef", "logical_op_id": "ce36d58df1", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 1.632849931716919, "cost_per_record": 0.0081975, "source_op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": "FALSE", "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 2847, "total_output_tokens": 108, "total_input_cost": 0.0071175000000000006, "total_output_cost": 0.00108, "filter_str": "The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron", "passed_filter": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 1.6302030086517334, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "filter": "Filter(The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron)"}}, {"record_id": "42b1bad2f6", "record_parent_id": "ecb4bcae41", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/martin-t-inbox-14-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "martin-t-inbox-14-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <2943840.1075841146795.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 6 Feb 2002 06:47:29 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nTo: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nSubject: Enron Mentions (major papers only) -- 02/06/02\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SPALME2>\nX-To: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spalme2>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Martin, Thomas A.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: MARTIN-T\nX-FileName: tom martin 6-25-02.PST\n\n\nQuestioning the Books: Enron Official Failed to Warn Participants Of 401(k)=\n Plan\nThe Wall Street Journal, 02/06/2002\n\nENRON EXECUTIVES SAY THEY DEBATED FREEZE ON PENSION\nThe New York Times, 02/06/2002\n\nRich Employee, Poor Employee; Senate Panel Looking at Pensions Shown Both S=\nides of the Enron Coin\nThe Washington Post, 02/06/2002\n\nExecs say they tried to protect workers' money=20\nHouston Chronicle, 02/06/2002\n\nEnron CEO Felt 'Betrayed,' Panel Told; Head of Internal Probe Testifies on =\nthe Hill\nThe Washington Post, 02/06/2002\n\nEnron Officials Sought Lawyer's Dismissal Over Negotiations With Outside Pa=\nrtnership\nThe Wall Street Journal, 02/06/2002\n\nThe Financial Wizard Tied to Enron's Fall\nThe New York Times, 02/06/2002\nEnron CEO Felt 'Betrayed,' Panel Told; Head of Internal Probe Testifies on =\nthe Hill\nThe Washington Post, 02/06/2002\n\n$270 Million Man Stays in the Background\nThe Washington Post, 02/06/2002\n\nEnron Execs Sold Stock as Losses Grew Probe: The $44-million sell-off came =\namid concern that problems at partnerships could become public.

Ms. Olson=\n said Ms. Watkins also sought out Jeffrey McMahon, currently Enron's chief =\noperating officer, who was then its treasurer, for guidance at the time.\nEnron's retirement plans, decimated by the collapse of the Houston energy c=\noncern, will come under further scrutiny in Congress this week. Today, Labo=\nr Secretary Elaine Chao testifies before the House Education and Workforce =\nCommittee about whether retirement-plan rules should change in the wake of =\nEnron's collapse; tomorrow the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor=\n and Pensions will hear from former Enron workers.=20\nIn yesterday's hearing, Ms. Olson said she didn't share Ms. Watkins's alleg=\nations with the other 401(k) plan trustees because she didn't feel it was h=\ner responsibility to repeat \"hearsay.\" In addition, she said, Ms. Watkins h=\nad come to her in confidence. After Ms. Watkins took her concerns to Mr. La=\ny and he ordered an investigation, \"I felt it was all in good hands,\" Ms. O=\nlson said.=20\nEli Gottesdiener, a Washington-based lawyer representing Enron workers, cou=\nntered those arguments. \"She had information that affected the lives of 10,=\n000 people and did nothing,\" he said, adding, \"It's so clear that she breac=\nhed her duty.\" He said Ms. Olson should have convened an emergency meeting =\nof the trustees to inform them of Ms. Watkins's allegations so that they co=\nuld launch their own investigation. The trustees immediately could have sto=\npped offering Enron stock as an investment option, and stopped using Enron =\nstock as a matching contribution in the retirement plan.=20\nMs. Olson testified that the plan trustees felt that they didn't have the a=\nbility to change the plan design without approval from the board of directo=\nrs.=20\nMs. Olson herself sold much of her own Enron holdings, most before she knew=\n of Ms. Watkins's concerns, but some afterward. Responding to sharp questio=\nning from lawmakers, including Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democra=\nt who heads the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Ms. Olson acknowledg=\ned she sold 83,000 Enron shares for $6.5 million, the bulk from December 20=\n00 to March 2001. She said she decided to sell the shares after having a fa=\nlling out with former Enron President Jeffrey Skilling over their different=\n management styles. Thinking about leaving the company, she said, she went =\nto a financial adviser who advised her to diversify her portfolio; at his s=\nuggestion, she said, she put the proceeds from selling her Enron shares int=\no government bonds.=20\nA few days before Enron filed for bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, Ms=\n. Olson said she sold an additional 3,000 Enron shares that were in her emp=\nloyee stock ownership plan, for $2 each. She said she didn't have knowledge=\n of the bankruptcy, but suspected the possibility.=20\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Lieberman said he would issue subpoenas to gather m=\nore information about the alleged payment of $105 million in bonuses to man=\nagement around the time Enron filed for Chapter 11, and the company's alleg=\ned failure to pay workers severance pay, beyond a one-time $4,500 payment.=\n=20\nAs Enron shares plunged last fall, the company also considered postponing a=\n planned \"blackout\" during which time employees wouldn't be able to change =\ntheir investments or sell Enron stock, said Ms. Olson and Enron benefits ma=\nnager Mikie Rath. Ms. Olson said she finally decided against a delay after =\nconsulting with other Enron executives and an outside lawyer several days b=\nefore the scheduled blackout that began on Oct. 26 last year and lasted for=\n about 10 trading days. She said the lawyer had advised Enron to go ahead w=\nith the blackout, on the grounds that it wouldn't be able to notify in time=\n all employees -- specifically about 11,000 retirees and other workers base=\nd outside of the Houston headquarters -- about a potential postponement.=20\nExecutives from Northern Trust Retirement Consulting LLC and Hewitt Associa=\ntes LLC, the companies that managed Enron's 401(k) plans, confirmed that th=\ney were contacted about the possibility of delaying the blackout period.=20\nMs. Olson said Enron hired counsel in early November to seek legal advice o=\nn whether it \"made sense\" to advise employees on selling their Enron stockh=\noldings.=20\nThis week's hearings are intended to generate more information for lawmaker=\ns who will decide whether retirement plans ought to be more carefully regul=\nated. House Energy and Commerce Chairman W.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin (R., La.) says=\n a top priority this year will be legislation aimed at protecting workers s=\nuch as those at Enron. \"Clearly, we need pension reform,\" Mr. Tauzin, the l=\neading congressional investigator into Enron, said in an interview.=20\nHowever, retirement-plan experts say any significant change will be an uphi=\nll battle, as employer groups, Republicans, and the Bush administration opp=\nose an overhaul -- in particular, any limits on company stock in retirement=\n plans.=20\nSomewhat less controversial are proposals, by Democrats and more recently b=\ny President Bush and Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Ben Cardin (D., Md.), that =\nwould provide employees greater ability to diversify out of stock contribut=\ned by their employer. Many employers now lock workers into such shares unti=\nl age 50 or later.=20\nOn this issue, there may be more opportunity for compromise, since so far, =\nall proposals still leave employers with the freedom to lock employees into=\n company stock for long periods. Mr. Bush's proposal has the weakest divers=\nification provisions, as it exempts many defined contribution savings plans=\n from proposed diversification rules, particularly ESOPs, which hundreds of=\n large employers use. Consequently, employers could continue to lock worker=\ns into company stock in many plans until age 55 and later.=20\n---=20\nGreg Hitt contributed to this article.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But after the debate on=\n the eve of the moratorium, they imposed the so-called blackout period to g=\nive themselves time to replace the administrators of the retirement plan.\nEnron executives said they decided it would be too hard to notify the parti=\ncipants in the company's 401(k) plan immediately. They also said they feare=\nd they would open themselves to lawsuits by plan participants who were noti=\nfied about the delay later than others for reasons like mail delays.=20\nThe disclosures on the pension plan came as other Congressional committees =\ntook up Enron matters.=20\nHouse and Senate lawmakers issued subpoenas to compel the testimony of Enro=\nn's former chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, while Congressional and state o=\nfficials broadened their investigations into why state pension funds and st=\nate agencies invested and did business with Enron as it spiraled downward l=\nast year.=20\nThe Senate Commerce Committee voted unanimously to issue the subpoena to re=\nquire Mr. Lay's appearance next Tuesday. A similar subpoena was issued by R=\nepresentative Michael G. Oxley, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the =\nHouse Financial Services Committee.=20\n", "sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions (major papers only) -- 02/06/02"}, "op_id": "0e91c184ef", "logical_op_id": "ce36d58df1", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 1.33640718460083, "cost_per_record": 0.0091075, "source_op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": "FALSE", "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 3263, "total_output_tokens": 95, "total_input_cost": 0.0081575, "total_output_cost": 0.0009500000000000001, "filter_str": "The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron", "passed_filter": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 1.3339221477508545, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "filter": "Filter(The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron)"}}, {"record_id": "1e01b01003", "record_parent_id": "d478d3c7c6", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/martin-t-inbox-16-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "martin-t-inbox-16-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <20131220.1075841148744.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 6 Feb 2002 05:36:49 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: enerfax1@bellsouth.net\nTo: enerfaxweb@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Enerfax Daily's free web version of gas & power prices and info\n (unknown)\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: enerfax1@bellsouth.net@ENRON\nX-To: Enerfaxweb@yahoogroups.com\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Martin, Thomas A.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: MARTIN-T\nX-FileName: tom martin 6-25-02.PST\n\n\n\nEnerfax Daily\nNORTH AMERICA'S FREE POWER AND GAS INFORMATION SOURCE=20\n   Wednesday, February 6 2002 No. 928\nVisit: http://www.enerfax.com  to view our web version or for Oil Prices & =\nNews http://www.enerfaxgold.com=20\n\nPHYSICAL NATURAL GAS PRICES  =20\nGulf/Eastern Region    =20\n| Agua Dulce              | 2.08  |\n| ANR SE                  | 2.14  |\n| Carthage TG             | 2.13  |\n| Chicago Citygate        | 2.20  |\n| Columbia Gulf Onshore   | 2.18  |\n| Dominion South Point    | 2.46  |\n| Henry Hub               | 2.20  |\n| Houston Ship Channel    | 2.19  |\n| Katy Hub                | 2.12  |\n| NGPL LA Pool            | 2.14  |\n| NGPL - Midcontinent     | 2.09  |\n| NGPL STX                | 2.09  |\n| NGPL TX/OK              | 2.12  |\n| NNG Demarc.             | 2.15  |\n| Niagara                 | 2.46  |\n| Sonat Tier 1            | 2.16  |\n| TCO IPP Pool            | 2.29  |\n| Tetco ELa               | 2.18  |\n| Tetco M-3               | 2.69  |\n| Tetco STX               | 2.11  |\n| TGP Zone 0              | 2.10  |\n| TGP Zone 1 (500 Leg)    | 2.16  |\n| TGT Zone SL             | 2.18  |\n| New York Citygate       | 3.00  |\n| Transco Station 65      | 2.22  |\n| Transco Zone 6 (NY)     | 3.00  |\n| Trunk ELa               | 2.14  |\n| Western Region         =20\n| California Border       | 2.16  |\n| El Paso Keystone        | 2.04  |\n| El Paso San Juan-Blanco | 2.05  |\n| Waha Hub                | 2.08  |\n| Canadian/Rockies Region=20\n| Nova/Aeco (C$/gig)      | 2.83  |\n| Dawn Hub/Union          | 2.29  |\n| Northwest Stanfield     | 1.99  |\n| Wyoming Pool            | 1.91  |\n| Opal                    | 1.91  |\n| PGT-Malin               | 2.08  |\n| Sumas                   | 1.95  |\nFlow Date 2/6\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nNATURAL GAS FUTURES\nHenry Hub=20\n12 Month Strip  2.4864  -0.0152      =20\n18 Month Strip  2.5950  -0.0073   =20\n| Month | High  |  Low  | Close | Change |\n|  MAR  | 2.140 | 2.070 | 2.074 | -0.043 |\n|  APR  | 2.200 | 2.150 | 2.152 | -0.032 |\n|  MAY  | 2.260 | 2.220 | 2.227 | -0.025 |\n|  JUN  | 2.325 | 2.290 | 2.297 | -0.020 |\n|  JUL  | 2.385 | 2.355 | 2.362 | -0.015 |\n|  AUG  | 2.435 | 2.415 | 2.419 | -0.013 |\n|  SEP  | 2.440 | 2.422 | 2.422 | -0.010 |\n|  OCT  | 2.460 | 2.440 | 2.450 | -0.009 |\n|  NOV  | 2.690 | 2.670 | 2.670 | -0.009 |\n|  DEC  | 2.895 | 2.870 | 2.873 | -0.006 |\n|  JAN  | 2.990 | 2.965 | 2.968 | -0.001 |\n|  FEB  | 2.940 | 2.920 | 2.923 | +0.001 |\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-\nRISK MANAGEMENT=20\nAcross the Energy Enterprise\n\ne-Acumen, Inc., is uniquely positioned to help you manage risk and increase=\n value.

The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu. The mark=\net dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the session bet=\nween $2.10  $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as locals sold down =\nthe contract to the $2.07 support level and went home short. The AGA will r=\nelease this weeks storage report this afternoon, and while some traders are=\n predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf withdrawal, look for the numbe=\nr to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in the Midwest and Texas, the growi=\nng differential between cash and futures, and the perceived premium in the =\nearly March contract have kept the market from dropping further. Physical p=\nrices retained their premium over futures yesterday on short-term cold weat=\nher at some pipelines, maintaining about a $0.07  $0.10 premium over the NY=\nMEX. But cash traders expect the demand to ease quickly as temperatures mod=\nerate by t! his weekend. As usual, the market will look to the weekly stora=\nge report for short term direction, but it is the massive amount of volumes=\n still in storage compared to last year that has put a cap on longer term p=\nrice increases. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada =\nwas generally flat to plus or minus a few cents yesterday.

In testimony before the House Ene=\nrgy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that Enron had a $500 million loss =\nin March. Rather than report it to shareholders, Enron gave a partnership c=\nalled Raptor another $800 million in Enron shares. He said that there is no=\n doubt that almost everyone, from the board of directors on down, knew that=\n the company was attempting to offset investment losses with stock. The par=\ntnerships allowed Enron to misrepresent earnings for a period spanning the =\n3rd quarter of 2000 through the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers t=\nold that committee that over 70% of Enrons earnings for that period were fa=\nlse. He said that there were red flags that should have alerted former chai=\nrman Ken L! ay to what was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely under=\nstood that Enron was using its own stock to offset the losses in the partne=\nrships.=20\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFAST.

Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\n\n02/01/2002\nThe Wall Street Journal\nA1\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nHOUSTON -- On Nov. 5, 1997, the top echelon of Enron Corp. assembled for a =\nmeeting that would help put the energy-trading giant on a fateful and ultim=\nately disastrous course.=20\nOn that day, Enron's now-infamous outside partnership arrangements took a t=\nurn from the straightforward and mundane to the deceptive and possibly ille=\ngal. The seven-member executive committee of the company's board approved a=\n management proposal to provide several hundred million dollars in loan gua=\nrantees for a new partnership named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca.\nWhile Enron had done business with previous partnerships, Chewco Investment=\ns was different. Unlike others where Enron had an ownership stake, Chewco w=\nas supposed to be completely independent. But it would be run and partly ow=\nned by an Enron executive, a young rising star named Michael Kopper.=20\nEnron Chairman Kenneth Lay arrived a little late, according to minutes of t=\nhe meeting obtained by The Wall Street Journal. He came in while Andrew Fas=\ntow, then senior vice president of finance, outlined a transaction that wou=\nld allow Chewco to buy, for $383 million, part of Enron's stake in another =\nlimited partnership known as JEDI. The deal kept JEDI in the Enron family, =\nbut off its books. That's because under accounting rules, Chewco provided e=\nnough independent ownership of JEDI to let Enron treat it as separate.=20\nHowever, with Enron financial guarantees and an Enron official at the helm,=\n there were questions from the beginning of how independent Chewco really w=\nas. Chewco thus set the pattern for a series of transactions that would mas=\nsively inflate Enron's earnings, while hiding billions in debt from shareho=\nlders and creditors.=20\nFour years later, on Nov. 8 last year, Enron acknowledged in a federal fili=\nng that it had overstated earnings by nearly $600 million since 1997. About=\n two-thirds of that, it told the Securities and Exchange Commission, was be=\ncause Chewco and JEDI had improperly been treated as separate entities able=\n to do income-producing deals with Enron. The disclosure sent a signal that=\n Enron hadn't been playing straight, and what had been an exodus of investo=\nrs and trading partners turned into a stampede. Within a month, Enron sough=\nt bankruptcy-law protection.=20\nFederal investigators and private litigators are now intently trying to lea=\nrn who knew what about Chewco, and when. Top former officials have distance=\nd themselves from it. In October, after the Journal first disclosed Chewco'=\ns existence, Mr. Lay privately told other Enron officials that he had never=\n heard of the partnership, according to one company executive. His wife, Li=\nnda Lay, told NBC recently that her husband had been kept in the dark about=\n a lot of the company's doings. Mr. Lay, who resigned from Enron last month=\n, couldn't be reached for comment and his attorney didn't return calls.=20\nJeffrey Skilling, who resigned suddenly as Enron's chief executive last sum=\nmer, said in press interviews late in December that he knew few details abo=\nut the partnership. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling said, \"We are=\nn't going to comment on leaks, counter-leaks, spin or speculation.\" An atto=\nrney for Mr. Kopper declined to comment. An attorney for Mr. Fastow said on=\nly that his client didn't have any financial interest in Chewco.=20\nThe meeting's minutes and other recently obtained documents show plenty of =\npeople at Enron knew about Chewco. Messrs. Lay, Skilling and Fastow were pa=\nrt of the 1997 executive-committee meeting. So were several board members. =\nOne -- Herbert \"Pug\" Winokur Jr., chairman of Capricorn Holdings Inc. in Gr=\neenwich, Conn. -- felt comfortable enough with Chewco that he approved its =\ncreation from an airport while boarding a flight.=20\nW. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for Mr. Winokur and other outside directors,=\n says the executive committee was told that \"Chewco was a special-purpose v=\nehicle not affiliated with the company. The board never waived the conflict=\n-of-interest policy for Mr. Kopper nor was the board told that Mr. Kopper w=\nas involved with Chewco.\" The meeting minutes indicate that Mr. Kopper was =\nin attendance, though the document misspells his name. The minutes don't sh=\now whether he was introduced or took part.=20\nDuring the presentation about Chewco, the meeting minutes say, Mr. Fastow \"=\nreviewed the economics of the project, the financing arrangements and the c=\norporate structure.\" Among the benefits the partnership was supposed to bri=\nng was \"positive income impact to Enron,\" according to a handout appended t=\no the minutes. The handout included diagrams of the complex financial struc=\nture.=20\nChewco isn't an issue just for Enron. Joseph Berardino, chief executive of =\nlongtime Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP, told Congress in December that =\nhis firm never would have let Enron treat Chewco and JEDI as arm's-length, =\nseparate entities had it known the entire truth about the entities' financi=\nng arrangements. At the time Chewco was being formed, Enron officials told =\nBarclays PLC, a lender involved in the deal, that Andersen had reviewed the=\n transaction's structure and approved it, according to someone familiar wit=\nh the discussions.=20\nA Barclays spokesman declines to comment. Andersen says Mr. Berardino, who =\nis scheduled to testify again next week before a House committee, stands by=\n his statement that his firm didn't know all the relevant facts about Chewc=\no four years ago.=20\nChewco altered a financial tool long used by the energy industry. Enron had=\n at times relied on off-balance-sheet partnerships and similar entities, as=\n had many competitors. Traditional \"off-balance-sheet financing is the tech=\nnique that has been used to build the independent power industry in the Uni=\nted States,\" says Didi Lacher, a New York executive of the German financial=\n firm Helaba. With such entities, companies can share the cost and risk of =\ndeveloping, say, a well or pipeline. By having the partnership borrow the m=\noney, the company can also keep the debt off its own balance sheet.=20\nThis financing is \"nonrecourse,\" meaning the sponsoring company isn't on th=\ne hook for the debt. But Enron kept off its balance sheet some debt in whic=\nh it had to cover any shortfalls, because of the partnerships' arrangements=\n. Over time, Enron accumulated billions of dollars of potential liability, =\nlittle of it publicly evident.=20\nTo do outside partnerships, some basic accounting guidelines have to be fol=\nlowed. The company has to relinquish control of any assets put into the par=\ntnership. It can't have side deals that oblige it to repurchase or redeem t=\nhe assets during the partnerships' lives, typically five to 10 years. Since=\n 1996, a partnership also has had to attract outside equity equal to at lea=\nst 3% of its total capital in order to be considered separate from the spon=\nsoring company. Enron's partnerships appear to have met these standards for=\n many years, but eventually Enron started to look at a higher-octane partne=\nrship.=20\nEnron under Mr. Lay assembled a team of bright young executives intent on b=\nuilding a global energy power. Led by Mr. Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co.=\n consultant, the core of the team started working together at Enron Capital=\n and Trade Resources, which handled energy trading and marketing. His lieut=\nenants included Mr. Fastow, a former Continental Bank finance specialist, a=\nnd Richard Causey, a former Andersen official.=20\nThey figured that for Enron to grow quickly, it couldn't be weighed down wi=\nth debt. Too much debt would threaten the company's credit rating and make =\nits financing costs higher.=20\nMr. Skilling and his subordinates placed an emphasis on rapid-fire trading =\nand deal-making, rather than on long-term investments in power plants and o=\nther \"hard\" assets.

Daniel Bayly, Merrill's investment-banking chief; and Schuyler Tilney, who heads Merrill's energy investment-banking department and directly oversees the firm's dealing with Enron on corporate-finance matters, the people said.\nThough each executive invested less than $1 million, the people said, their involvement highlights the role played by senior Wall Street officials in helping to create some of the partnerships Enron used to pad its earnings and hide debt from investors -- and that eventually resulted in huge losses that led to the energy-trading company's downfall. \nMr. Davis, Mr. Tilney and Mr. Bayly didn't return calls for comment. Joseph Cohen, a Merrill spokesman, said the investments were entirely appropriate, and common on Wall Street. \nThe personal investments were part of a total of $22 million Merrill and its officials committed to invest in the partnership, known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. This partnership was particularly controversial because it allowed some Enron officials to make far more money working part time on the partnerships than they did working full time for Enron. The energy company has estimated, for instance, that Andrew Fastow, whom Enron replaced as chief financial officer in October as pressures on the company mounted, made more than $30 million since 1999 running LJM2 and a smaller partnership, called LJM Cayman LP. \nAt issue for Merrill is the potential for conflicts of interest. Merrill, like other Wall Street firms, wore a number of hats with Enron: The securities firm acted at various times as securities underwriter and investor with the energy company. Since 1990, Merrill was among the top five underwriters of Enron's stock and bond deals, according to Thomson Financial, earning fees for helping to raise about $3.7 billion in securities issues for the company. Thus, some critics question whether Merrill officials would let their personal investments with Enron entities interfere with their business decisions in dealing with the energy company. \n\"Merrill's involvement as underwriter for Enron and its executives' investments raises serious conflict-of-interest questions,\" says Jacob Zamansky, a New York-based plaintiffs' lawyer. \"It gives the appearance that Merrill did this to get Enron deals. Merrill had a vested interest in . . . the partnership and investing\" in it. \nThere are other conflicts as well, securities lawyers say. Some top executives at Merrill declined to invest their money because they believed that the Enron partnership -- which kept assets off Enron's balance sheet -- wouldn't get the best investments, which would be kept by the corporate parent. Another concern: Enron's Mr. Fastow suggested the idea of investing in the partnership to Mr. Tilney, whose wife until last week was a managing director of Enron's energy-services unit. Mr. Fastow through a spokesman had no comment. \nIt is unclear if top Merrill executives, who also worked on Enron's financings, had more information about the nature of the LJM2 partnership than Merrill's individual customers who were offered opportunities to invest in the partnership. \"I'm not saying that Merrill violated the law here,\" says John Coffee, a professor of securities law at Columbia University in New York. \"But this is a big public-policy issue. Merrill has an obligation, because Enron is a client, not to reveal some confidential information, but it also has a fiduciary obligation to its investors to tell them if these securities aren't suitable for them.\" \nMr. Cohen, the Merrill spokesman, brushes aside such concerns. \"The investment partnership was reviewed and deemed appropriate by parties on all sides of the transaction,\" Mr. Cohen said, reading from a prepared statement. \"Consistent with common industry practice, it was offered to qualified external as well as internal investors, and this is not a conflict of interest.\" \nMr. Cohen added that Merrill high-net-worth clients \"in the partnership offering were given the same information as all Merrill executives who wanted to invest.\" \nMr. Davis, who at the time of the investment headed the institutional-securities group, appears to be the only official on Merrill's executive committee to have invested in the partnership. Even though close to 100 Merrill executives invested in the partnership, neither Chief Executive Officer David Komansky nor his heir apparent, President E. Stanley O'Neal, were in the group, people close to the deal said. One person with knowledge of the matter said some top executives balked at investing their own money because they were uncomfortable with some LJM2 investments. Mr. Davis, however, headed the institutional group, which counted Enron as one of its big clients. \nMerrill, which helped market LJM2 to more than three dozen institutional and individual investors, was only one of many Wall Street firms to invest in the $386.6 million partnership. Other corporate investors in the partnership included Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., two units of Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., First Union Corp. and the CIBC World Markets unit of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. \nThe funds for a $15 million investment from J.P. Morgan Chase came from the private-equity unit of J.P. Morgan, which invests the firm's own funds. While individual Morgan bankers may have stakes in those funds, they didn't have any direct, separate stakes in LJM2, a spokeswoman said. \nAt Citigroup and Lehman Brothers, which committed $10 million each, and CIBC World Markets, which committed $15 million, the funds came from the firms' own assets and not from outside clients or individual investment bankers, according to people familiar with the investments. \nOfficials declined to comment at CSFB, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, whose DLJ Fund Investment Partners III LP made a $5 million commitment, while a CSFB affiliate named Merchant Capital Inc. committed $10 million. Company representatives had no comment at Deutsche Bank, where an affiliate of its former Bankers Trust unit, BT Investment Partners, committed $10 million, and First Union, whose First Union Investors Inc. committed $25 million. \nOfficials at some of these Wall Street firms said their investment committees felt pressured to make the investments in order to stay in the running for investment-banking assignments. Some bankers were concerned about whether they were being asked to make uneconomical investments in corporate castoffs that wouldn't appreciate in value. Indeed, it is unclear what returns, if any, the LJM2 partnership investment has generated for limited partners and investors. \nWall Street securities firms have long made investments associated with their investment-banking business. Sometimes the investments are made to provide extra capital to help clients complete deals. Sometimes the investments are used to acquire an asset a client wants to sell. The funds may come from the securities firm itself, from investment clients, or individuals at the firm who may be offered the chance to make the investments as part of their compensation packages. \nWhat was unusual about the Merrill investment in the Enron vehicle was that some senior bankers chose not to participate out of concern about what the partnership would invest in. In addition, some of Merrill's top executives, including Mr. Komansky, Merrill's chief executive, had been embarrassed in 1998 by disclosure that they had taken personal stakes in Long-Term Capital Management, the highflying hedge fund for which Merrill had raised funds and whose near collapse jeopardized the entire U.S. financial system.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

A case study in corporate rot.\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\nBy Jake Tapper\nJan. 29, 2002 | When she heard that Kristina Mordaunt had been mixed up in Enron's infamous LJM partnership, Julia Murray broke down in tears. \nMurray, an Enron in-house counsel, wasn't known within the firm for such emotional displays. Enron was a hard-charging company that attracted tough-as-nails Type A executives and lawyers. But Kristina Mordaunt, a fellow Enron attorney who had worked in the counsel's office before joining the company's financial division, was Murray's close friend. And the news about her was rather shocking: On Nov. 7, 2001, Mordaunt was fired and escorted from the Enron building in downtown Houston by company security. According to four current or former Enron executives, Mordaunt was fired after the company found that she had made a windfall profit off LJM, one of the controversial -- and possibly illegal -- partnerships set up by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. \nAccording to these sources, there is a lesson in Kristina Mordaunt's downfall. The ignominious exit of employees like Mordaunt, who had enjoyed the trust and respect of fellow company attorneys and managers, shows how Enron's corporate culture rotted from within, under the twin pressures of financial ambition and personal greed. \nA few weeks before Mordaunt was fired, Enron had announced that her former boss Fastow was on a \"leave of absence.\" But few inside the company expected him back. On Oct. 31, Enron had reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission had upgraded its interest in the company's financial dealings from an inquiry to a formal investigation. Within Enron, the board of directors set up a special internal committee to investigate the company's convoluted finances as well. Soon, according to the four Enron sources, the committee stumbled upon stunning news: Working with Fastow, Mordaunt and Enron treasurer Ben Glisan had invested around $6,000 apiece in LJM, one of the limited partnerships Enron had established to hide its debt. Within a few weeks, they each made approximately $1 million from those investments. Enron later revealed that Fastow himself, the financial wizard behind the partnerships scheme, earned as much as $30 million from his role in managing the partnerships. \nDue to Enron's complex -- some think purposely confusing -- financial arrangements, those numbers could not be confirmed with documentation, though they were reported to Salon by the four current or former Enron executives. A congressional investigator also informed Salon that his committee has been given the same information and is currently trying to verify the charge. \nWhat is clear is that Mordaunt and Glisan were key members of the team Fastow worked with to set up these questionable partnerships, and they appear to have benefited dramatically. \"Mordaunt, for all practical purposes, was Fastow's lawyer at Enron\" since she was \"the top lawyer in his division,\" at the time, said one former Enron executive. After working for Fastow, Mordaunt later became chief counsel for a separate Enron division called EBS -- which itself was involved in highly questionable accounting activities. \nMordaunt could not be reached for comment by Salon, but according to a former Enron employee, \"She has told people that she doesn't think she did anything wrong.\" \nGlisan declined to comment. \"I've been advised not to talk to anybody,\" he told Salon. Glisan referred calls to his attorney, Hank Schuelke, with the Washington, D.C., law firm Janis Schuelke & Wechsler. Asked about the allegation against Glisan, Bill Shields, an attorney with the firm, said only, \"We're not going to have any comment.\" \nSo far, according to the congressional investigator, the world knows \"just the tip of the iceberg\" about what drove Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, into the biggest U.S. bankruptcy of all time, depriving investors and employees of at least $1 billion. Up to this point, most of the public's attention has been focused on Enron's political connections and the failure of Wall Street's so-called gatekeepers -- the analysts, banks, credit agencies and analysts -- to sound a warning bell. But the inside story of Enron's corporate culture -- as the company transformed itself from an energy trader whose business was rooted in the physical delivery of gas and electricity into a high-finance wheeler-dealer whose business was primarily manipulating numbers -- is just coming to light. This part of the story is about greed, betrayal and deception -- and its human costs, in broken friendships, ruined careers and worse. \nThe apparent suicide of former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Baxter on Friday might be the most dramatic example so far of this human cost. But Enron's corporate ranks have been suffering many shocks since last fall -- and the revelation about Mordaunt and Glisan was one of them. Many executives were stunned to learn that these two trusted co-workers and friends had been raking in such extraordinary amounts of cash. Though Julia Murray declined to comment to Salon, her tearful reaction to the news about her friend Mordaunt last November indicate the deep emotional wounds inflicted by some of Enron's suddenly rich managers as they grabbed their cash and ran for the door.\n\"Did I feel betrayed? Yeah, a lot,\" said an Enron executive and friend of both Mordaunt and Glisan who would speak with Salon only on the condition of anonymity. \"I was extremely surprised.\" \nAfter the news about Mordaunt and Glisan broke inside the company, colleagues rushed to see who else might have been involved in the scandal. After Mordaunt was escorted out of the Enron building, said one executive, \"I called a number of people I know who work in the finance division and said, 'Please tell me that you didn't invest in LJM!\" \nLJM along with LJM2 and Chewco have become the most notorious of the shady accounting partnerships set up by Enron. Set up, it is now believed, specifically to hide Enron debt from public scrutiny, the partnerships proved to be the catalyst for Enron's fall. \nOn Nov. 8, 2001, the same day the company announced that its financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 \"should not be relied upon,\" Enron filed an \"8-K\" form -- an interim document required for certain types of financial events -- with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In that form, <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/> Enron disclosed that some of the \"limited partners\" in the partnerships \"were, at the time of the investment, non-executive officers or employees of Enron.\" Enron also announced that it was \"terminating the employment\" of Glisan and Mordaunt for participating in the LJM partnerships. \n\"At the time these individuals invested in the limited partnership, LJM1 had ceased entering into new transactions with Enron,\" Enron's 8-K stated. \"However, some pre-existing investments involving LJM1 and Enron were still in effect, and Enron believes that these investments resulted in distributions or payments to LJM1 and to the limited partnership in which these individuals invested.\" \nAccording to the congressional investigator, Mordaunt reaped her LJM windfall after she was approached by an Enron executive, who asked her if she wanted to make some money. Yes, she said. \"Give me a check for $6,000,\" he told her, according to the congressional investigator. Later, the executive asked Mordaunt for her bank account number so he could deposit the proceeds from her investment. \"How much is it?\" she asked. He told her to check her bank account the next day. When she did, she discovered over $1 million had been deposited into her account. The congressional committee is currently investigating the matter. \nThe Nov. 8 SEC filing also clarified Fastow's role in the company. He was no longer officially on a leave of absence. He \"is no longer working for Enron,\" the filing stated. \nAt a November news conference, then-CEO Kenneth Lay reported that he knew about the partnerships but not about Mordaunt's and Glisan's role in them. \nAsked last week about the allegations against Mordaunt and Glisan, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said, \"I have no idea.\" Palmer noted that a special committee had been appointed \"to look into\" such matters. \"I know they're looking into everything surrounding those transactions,\" he said, referring to the partnerships. \nSaid another former Enron executive after hearing about Mordaunt's and Glisan's lucrative deals: \"Hillary Clinton should have gone to their school of futures trading.\" \nTo many of their former colleagues, Mordaunt's and Glisan's closeness to Fastow's suspicious transactions makes things look even worse. \"To many of us, this looks and smells like a bribe,\" said one Enron former employee. \"'I' -- Fastow -- 'will give you money, you shut up.' Or put another way, 'Here is the payoff for helping me set up the structures that helped me rake in more than $30 million.'\" The two weren't merely \"Enron executives,\" the former employee says, \"they were the treasurer and one of the top lawyers in the company. And both of them worked on LJM-related deals. That is what makes it sickening.\" \nThe accusations highlight the personal betrayal many Enron executives feel. After Mordaunt and Glisan were fired last November, their former colleagues spent much time trying to figure out how it all could have happened. \nMordaunt, according to a current Enron executive, \"was very tight with Andy [Fastow]. Andy was responsible for making her managing director, and she would have done anything for him.\" Nonetheless, as a lawyer, Mordaunt should have known better, the executive said. \"Given his connection with LJM, which was dicey at best and at worst probably illegal, I personally would have stayed far away from it. But you never know how Andy spun it to her.\" \nAfter working as Fastow's top lawyer, Mordaunt later served as chief counsel for EBS, an Enron subsidiary set up specifically to handle another complex partnership, code-named Braveheart. In Braveheart, Enron sold 10 years' worth of future revenue from a broadband interactive television deal it was setting up with Blockbuster. Although the deal itself never went past the testing stage, Enron booked $110 million worth of revenue for selling off those future, never-to-be-realized earnings. \nGlisan also played a key role in Fastow's division, a former Enron executive noted: \"All the deals we did had to go through Glisan and get his approval because of the impact on funds flow.\" The former executive, like others affiliated with the firm, said that he once had a positive impression of Glisan and was surprised to learn that he had been an LJM investor. \nTo some current and former Enron executives, the transformation of respected managers like Mordaunt and Glisan represented a major shift in the company ethos. \"In my opinion this all goes back to when Jeff Skilling took over and Enron ceased being an energy company and we became an earnings company,\" said one former executive, referring to Enron's metamorphosis into a company that focused more on highly complex financial-derivatives trading than on actual commodities. \nIn 1997, Skilling became the company's president and chief operating officer. Press accounts of Enron's rise traditionally gave him credit for Enron's increasing focus on complex financing schemes and risky leaps into such areas as bandwidth trading, an enterprise that ended up costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars. \nSkilling was \"all hype,\" the one-time executive says. \"Everything he did was to hype the stock. And they had this need to create complex financial dealings to hide all the things going wrong. \n\"Once we became an earnings-focused company, that was the beginning of the end.\" The former executive said he's still unsure whether recently resigned CEO Lay knew everything that was going on. \"But that doesn't excuse him. Captain Joe Hazelwood didn't know that the guy was going to run the Valdez into the reef. But he was Captain Hazelwood. It was his ship.\" \nThe company's business practices changed under Skilling, this former executive said. And so did the attitudes of managers like Mordaunt and Glisan -- and Lay, for that matter. Keeping the stock price up, at all costs, became the order of the day, even if that meant telling employees all was fine, when in fact the company's situation was rapidly deteriorating. \n\"[Lay] lied to us starting in August,\" said the former executive. \"He lied to us.\" In August, Lay went before the company and announced that Skilling was resigning for personal reasons. In an all-employees meeting, Lay told a touching tale about why Skilling felt the need to leave the company. \nSkilling, Lay said, had recently visited the Teesside Power Station, Enron's gas-fired power plant in northeast England, where an Aug. 8 explosion and fire had killed three Enron employees. \"It shook him up so much he realized how much he had sacrificed with his own family,\" one executive recalled Lay saying. \"And he wanted to spend more time with his kids.\" Lay then told the company more lies, according to the executive: that Enron had just enjoyed the best quarter in its history; that it was going to be more friendly to Wall Street; it was going to simplify its accounting practices; there were no other people other than Fastow involved in the shady partnerships. \n\"About two weeks later, the news came out about Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt,\" recalled the executive. Soon afterward, the company was told that \"we would have to restate our earnings for the past five years.\" \nThen came the news that executives like Lay had been dumping their stock for years while simultaneously telling stockholders and employees that all was fine and the stock would soon bounce back. In hindsight, few Enron executives believe that Skilling's departure had anything to do with the Teesside Power Station tragedy. \n\"Lay got in front of the entire company and just lied,\" said the executive, who has lost his life savings. \"I feel like a schmuck.\" \n\nsalon.com \n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nA Section\nEnron Directors Backed Moving Debt Off Books\nKathleen Day and Peter Behr\nWashington Post Staff Writers\n\n01/31/2002\nThe Washington Post\nFINAL\nA01\nCopyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved\n\nMembers of Enron Corp.'s board of directors received detailed briefings as early as four years ago about the purpose and structure of controversial partnerships whose losses triggered the company's fall into bankruptcy, according to minutes of the meetings. \nThe minutes, which cover four board meetings in 1997 and 1999 and three meetings of the board's finance committee in 2000, suggest that board members approved aggressive accounting actions, including moving debt off the company books.\nA dozen congressional committees as well as the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's collapse, which cost investors and employees billions of dollars. A focus of the inquiries is whether Enron hid debt and inflated its profits by using the private partnerships run by its chief financial officer. \nIn other Enron-related news yesterday, the General Accounting Office announced that it would sue the White House for access to records of Vice President Cheney's meetings with Enron and other industry interests that sought to influence the administration's energy policy last year. And Stephen Cooper, the interim head of Enron, said he was optimistic the company could survive, though in a much diminished form. \nIndividual Enron board members, who themselves are being sued and investigated, have said little publicly about their role in the transactions that toppled the company. The minutes, made available to The Washington Post by a source critical of the board, suggest that the partnerships were a key part of Enron's growth strategy and show they were regularly reviewed by the directors. \nThe copies of the minutes do not cover every board meeting and do not include documents that are referred to as being attached to the summaries of the board's actions. \nWhen it was reported last fall that Andrew Fastow, the Enron CFO, made $30 million running partnerships with names such as LJM, Raptor and JEDI, then-chairman Kenneth L. Lay announced that the board was setting up a special committee to investigate. The minutes show that members of that special committee attended board meetings in which Fastow described the intricacy of the entities. \nSources said the committee's report, which is expected to be completed as early as tomorrow, will say that while the Enron board approved the partnerships, management and auditors withheld key information from them. That is expected to be the key element of the defense that will be offered by Lay and board member William C. Powers Jr. when they testify before Congress on Monday, sources said. Last night, Robert Bennett, a Washington lawyer representing Enron, gave every indication that would be the case. \n\"While the board of directors, including Mr. Lay, were aware that these special partnership entities were being set up, which were being run by Mr. Fastow, there is a great deal of information regarding their operation and execution that was unknown to the board of directors,\" Bennett said. \nAt an Oct. 11, 1999, board meeting, Fastow discussed the company's mix of \"on-balance and off-balance sheet debt,\" according to the minutes. At another meeting on May 1, 2000, Fastow told board members about the risk of \"accounting scrutiny\" on the Raptor partnership. \nA board resolution in October 1999 said one purpose of the LJM2 partnership was to create \"a potential ready purchaser of the company's businesses and assets.\" A chart labeled \"LJM2 Update,\" attached to the agenda for a May 2000 finance committee meeting, said the partnership had made seven investments, all purchased from Enron. \nEnron has disclosed that the board waived the company's conflict-of-interest rules to let Fastow oversee the partnerships. \nThe board's special committee hired William R. McLucas, former head of enforcement at the SEC, to do the investigation and write a report for the committee. The report is expected to be released before Lay, who resigned last week, and board member Powers, who is also dean of the University of Texas law school, testify before Congress on Monday. \nUntil now, Congress has focused on the role Enron's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, played in the company's collapse and the reported destruction by Andersen executives of Enron-related documents. Monday's hearings are expected to zero in on the behavior of Enron officials, including the board. \nThe outside directors are expected, as part of their defense, to push the focus back on Andersen, sources say. They will point, for example, to portions of board minutes that say Andersen \"had spent considerable time analyzing . . . the governance structure\" of one of the partnerships, LJM2, and \"was comfortable with the proposed transaction.\" \nMinutes from October 1999 and October 2000 say the board ordered several safeguards be implemented to maintain control of the partnerships. One was allowing Lay or the board to remove Fastow from one partnership, LJM, at any time. Another was directing then-Enron chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling and others to review all transactions between Enron and LJM. And Skilling was to review Fastow's \"economic interest\" in the partnership. \nBennett said, \"We have learned that many of the procedures that were put into place to ensure the appropriate operation of these entities were not complied with, without the knowledge of the board.\" \nPatrick McGurn of Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. of Rockville, which advises large shareholders on corporate-governance issues, said last night that the minutes seem to provide more evidence that board members were fully informed of the company's aggressive financial strategies. \n\"If that's not the case, the directors better start talking and start talking now. Every step along the way it seems this board had the opportunity to say no to the partnerships, to the waiver of the ethics code, and each time they had an opportunity to take the right fork in the road, they took the wrong fork.\" \nThe Oct. 12, 1999, minutes show that outside director Herbert Winokur -- now a member of the board's special investigating committee -- recommended that the board approve Fastow's participation in the LJM2 partnership. \nMcGurn said, \"The first principle of an investigation is that the people who presumably might be held responsible at the end of the day can't investigate themselves.\" \nThe other two members of the special committee -- Powers and Raymond S. Troubh, a New York consultant -- had no involvement with the company when the formation of the off-balance-sheet entities took place, sources close to the company said. \nW. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the outside directors of the board, said Winokur has no conflict of interest in serving on that special committee, despite his role in approving the partnership deals. \"It was important for the special committee to render its report quickly and Mr. Winokur's participation provided continuity and speed to the special committee's efforts,\" Eggleston said. \nThe board minutes show that as early as Dec. 9, 1997, Enron's executive committee approved a buyout -- that included a corporate guarantee of $633 million -- of the interest of the California public employees pension fund in the JEDI partnership. \nAt an Aug. 7, 2000, meeting of the finance committee, chaired by Winokur, the off-balance-sheet partnerships are described as \"the vehicles the company was utilizing to manage its balance sheet debt.\" Directors Wendy Gramm and Lay were among other board members that also attended the meeting. \nAt a special board meeting on June 28, 1999, Lay called on Skilling to discuss a proposed investment partnership. \"Mr. Skilling noted that due to changes in the accounting treatment of off-balance-sheet transactions, the company had been analyzing new types of financing vehicles. He called on Mr. Fastow to discuss the proposal.\" \nSkilling resigned suddenly in August. Fastow was ousted in October. \nThe LJM partnerships were specifically cited by the company last fall when it admitted violating some accounting standards, resulting in a $586 million overstatement of its profits between 1997 and 2001. \nThe excerpts that became available yesterday give no hint that board members had questions or qualms about the accounting maneuvers, with the exception of Fastow's dual role as Enron's chief financial officer and LJM's manager. \nStaff writers David Hilzenrath, Albert B. Crenshaw and Carrie Johnson contributed to this report. Peter Behr reported from Houston.\n\n\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com \nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Lay has until Feb. 12 to respond. \nQuestions posed to Lay in a letter signed by Rep. W.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin, R-La., committee chairman, and other members seek details on how the memo was distributed and whether Ceconi's allegations were investigated. \n", "sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions -- 01/31/02"}, "op_id": "0e91c184ef", "logical_op_id": "ce36d58df1", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 1.842850685119629, "cost_per_record": 0.0224975, "source_op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": "FALSE", "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 8455, "total_output_tokens": 136, "total_input_cost": 0.0211375, "total_output_cost": 0.00136, "filter_str": "The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron", "passed_filter": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 1.8393988609313965, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "filter": "Filter(The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron)"}}, {"record_id": "6332435659", "record_parent_id": "ac6c1834ee", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/martin-t-inbox-96-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "martin-t-inbox-96-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <8664618.1075841171256.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 18 Jan 2002 14:32:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nTo: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nSubject: Enron Mentions -- 01/18/02\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SPALME2>\nX-To: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spalme2>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Martin, Thomas A.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: MARTIN-T\nX-FileName: tom martin 6-25-02.PST\n\n\nMore than one Enron official warned company about growing crisis\nSalon.com, 01/18/2002\n\nIf Enron isn't a political scandal, nothing is\nSalon.com, 01/18/2002\n\nUSA: Enron lawyer raised partnership concerns-Salon.com.\nReuters English News Service, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron CEO under fire again \nReport: Lay knew of accounting problems when he exercised options. \nCNN, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron Attorney Asks Judge to Approve Sale of Energy-Trading Operations\nDow Jones Business News, 01/18/2002\n\nBlackstone says Enron unit could earn 1-2 bln usd a year if UBS deal approved\nAFX News, 01/18/2002\n\nRuling on Enron sale expected Friday\nEnron fires Andersen as auditor \nCBS.MarketWatch.com, 01/18/2002\nCheney discussed Enron with Indian leader\nCNN, 01/18/2002\n\nUSA: UPDATE 2-Cheney spoke to Indian officials on Enron project.\nReuters English News Service, 01/18/2002\n\nCheney's Mention of Enron To Indian Politician Draws Attention\nCNN: Live Today, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron Fires Andersen As Auditor\nChannel 2 Houston, 01/18/2002\n\nUSA: Florida subpoenaes Enron papers in pension probe.\nReuters English News Service, 01/18/2002\n\nPOWER POINTS: Enron Energy Services Still In The Game\nDow Jones Energy Service, 01/18/2002\n\nPataki giving donation from wife of Enron chief to employees' fund\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nPetrobras Eyes Enron's Stake in TGS.\nBusiness News Americas, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron subsidiary in Bothell strapped for cash\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nUSA: UPDATE 1-Moody's may change the way it rates companies.\nReuters English News Service, 01/18/2002\n\nTHE SKEPTIC: Accountants Under The Microscope Post-Enron\nDow Jones International News, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron 'winners' outside Beltway\nNeither party can benefit\nMSNBC.com, 01/18/2002\n\nFlorida governor speaks at father's presidential museum\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nFormer Enron Lobbyist Racicot Elected Republican Chairman\nDow Jones Energy Service, 01/18/2002\n\nCarson returns Enron contribution\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nSen.

Another executive was reassigned after raising alarms.\nBy Jake Tapper, Salon.com\nJan. 18, 2002 | In recent weeks, Enron executives have insisted that their controversial -- and ultimately disastrous -- accounting strategies were legally vetted. But Salon has learned that a law firm hired secretly by one of Enron's own attorneys last year recommended that the huge energy trader stop setting up the financial instruments whose exposure later drove the company into bankruptcy. \nAt the heart of the Enron scandal are a series of complex partnerships that Enron employed to keep billions of dollars of debt off its books -- thus boosting both its quarterly profits and its credit level. Enron executives participated in these partnerships, earning millions of dollars in management fees and raising major conflict-of-interest issues. \nEmbattled Enron CEO Ken Lay has attempted to justify the partnerships by noting that Enron's own staff attorneys as well as those at Vinson & Elkins, its powerful outside law firm, signed off on them. Despite this legal advice, it was reported earlier this week that one Enron executive, Sherron S. Watkins, raised serious questions about the propriety of the partnerships in a memo sent to Lay in late August. Salon has now learned of two other major instances in which Enron executives were told by company colleagues that the partnerships were deeply troubling and possibly illegal. \nIn one case, an Enron staff attorney took the extraordinarily unusual step of secretly retaining another outside law firm to evaluate the legality of the partnerships set up by then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. \nLast summer, before Enron was forced to reveal the actual state of its finances, Fastow moved to set up more of these partnerships. But Fastow's plan was blocked when an Enron attorney named Jordan Mintz took matters into his own hands. According to sources inside Enron, Mintz, who had just moved from the company's tax department to its finance department, was so concerned about the questionable nature of the partnerships -- and apparently so worried that Enron's attorneys were too close to the business schemes to judge them correctly -- that he sought a second legal opinion. \n\nWithout the knowledge of his boss, Enron chief counsel James Derrick Jr., Mintz hired an outside firm far removed from Enron and its Houston-based firm, Vinson & Elkins, to take a fresh look at the questionable deals. After reviewing the partnerships, the respected New York firm hired by Mintz -- Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson -- recommended to him that Enron stop setting up the the shell partnerships. The New York firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to company executives urging Enron to halt the practice -- which they apparently did. In October, Enron fired Fastow. Last month, he hired celebrated attorney David Boies, who represented Vice President Al Gore during his Florida recount battles. \nContacted Wednesday night, Mintz declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege. When asked about the Mintz retention of outside counsel, Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said \"this is the first I've heard of that\" and declined to comment further. A spokesman for Fried Frank did not return a call for comment. \nWithout specifically confirming the Mintz episode, House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Ken Johnson said that worried Enron executives did go outside the company for legal advice: \"(This) happened in a couple instances. There was more than one person who was spooked by these partnerships.\" \nIt is unusual for a corporate lawyer to go behind the back of his boss, the chief counsel, and retain an outside firm to do work for a company. And it was against standard operating procedure at Enron, where chief counsel Derrick had to approve of any outside legal work. But Mintz apparently thought that Derrick, who had worked at Vinson & Elkins before joining Enron, was too much a part of the company's closed culture, in which dubious business practices had become the norm.\nNo less than 10 congressional committees are investigating the collapse of Enron, an energy trading company with close ties to politicians in general and the Bush administration in particular. On Wednesday the Senate Finance Committee joined the ranks of nine other House and Senate bodies -- as well as the Departments of Labor and Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service -- by announcing that it, too, would look into the largest bankruptcy in American history. \nOn Wednesday, investigators with the House Energy & Commerce Committee interviewed David Duncan, the former Enron auditor with Arthur Andersen who had been fired the day before. \nOne of the primary questions under investigation is why Fastow and other Enron executives were permitted to establish complex and secretive partnerships with odd, obscure names -- LJM1, LJM2, JEDI, Chewco, the Raptor entities, Osprey, Big Doe -- that allegedly reaped these partners windfall profits while hiding Enron debt. In November, Enron had to revise its finance statements for the past four and a half years, acknowledging that the company was $600 million in net income poorer than it had led the government and its investors to believe. The Houston company also had to acknowledge an additional $2.5 billion in debt -- much of which came from these murky \"partnerships.\" Recent revelations tied to the Watkins memo may result in billions more debt added to the Enron ledger. \n\"Someone should have stepped up and said, 'No, you can't do these sort of things!'\" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. But for too long no one did, the employee added. And then when someone finally spoke up, it was too late. \nCurrently, much is being made in the media of Watkins' August letter to CEO Kenneth Lay, released on Tuesday by investigators with the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals,\" Watkins wrote. \"The business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax.\" \nBut Watkins' letter, said one source, was not the only alarm being sounded within the company before it imploded. In addition to the flags raised by Watkins and Mintz, then-treasurer Jeff McMahon also aired his own growing concern. In her memo, Watkins alluded to McMahon's tribulation, writing that he \"was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of [the] LJM [partnership]. He complained mightily to [chief executive] Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later, Skilling offered him the CEO spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the five steps with him.\" \nIn the eyes of many Enron executives at the time, McMahon's new assignment was meant to silence him. McMahon \"learned about these partnerships and he thought they were wrong,\" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. \"He thought they were a huge conflict of interest.\" McMahon, according to this source, went to Skilling and said, \"'We have this problem, and I think there's a conflict.' Skilling says, 'I'll take a look at it; I'll take care of it.' And the next thing you know, he's reassigned. And it was not a promotion.\" To other executives it looked like retaliation against a whistleblower, an Enron source said. \nMcMahon \"did go to Jeff Skilling and tell him he was uncomfortable with the internal and external conflicts the LJM partnerships were creating,\" confirmed Enron spokesman Palmer. \"And he told him he could no longer serve as treasurer with those conflincts in place.\" As for whether the reassignment was a demotion of any sort, Palmer said, \"It's probably open to interpretation by a lot of people.\" \nIn August, the same month Watkins wrote her memo, Skilling himself resigned from Enron under mysterious circumstances. McMahon, who replaced Fastow as Enron's chief financial officer in October, did not return a call for comment. \n\"We hope in the very near future to be interviewing Mr. McMahon,\" House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Johnson said. \"We feel he has a lot to offer.\" Johnson's committee has uncovered a number of incriminating details in the Enron investigation, including the shredding of documents and the Watkins memo. \nA congressional source also reports that such matters may be just the tip of the iceberg, that much more damaging information will be coming out in the next few weeks dealing with the Enron partnerships. \n________\n\n\n \n\n \nIf Enron isn't a political scandal, nothing is\nSo what if Bush and company didn't bail out Enron? The outrage lies in what politicians did for the company on its way up, not the way down.\nBy Scott Rosenberg, Salon.com\nJan. 18, 2002 | The collapse of Enron, we now hear, is not a \"political scandal\" -- it's a \"business story.\" A fine distinction! So far, no one possesses evidence that government officials lied, goofed around with interns, ran guns from the White House basement, burglarized opponents' campaign offices or accepted bags of unmarked bills. And so a growing chorus in the media now chants that the Enron affair should not be considered in the same class as Whitewater, Watergate, Iran/Contra or any of the other previous brouhahas that have consumed Washington and brought presidencies to their knees. \nThis tells us that the scandal yardstick our political and media culture currently uses is bent like a pretzel. You say your president may have finagled a real estate deal many years ago? Time to name a special prosecutor! He lied about his sex life? Draw up the articles of impeachment! But tell us that a high-profile corporation donated millions of dollars to legions of politicians, including the president; bent the government to its will; lined the pockets of its executives while dodging all taxes; then went bankrupt, vaporizing thousands of employees' retirement accounts? Nah, that's no \"political scandal.\" Come on -- where're the bimbos? \nEnron's dismal story simply doesn't meet the high bar of triviality the press today demands. The sums of money involved are too great; the flaws in our political system that it exposes are too vast. It's just too real to qualify. \n\n\nUSA: Enron lawyer raised partnership concerns-Salon.com.\n\n01/18/2002\nReuters English News Service\n(C) Reuters Limited 2002.\n\nNEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - An Enron Corp. lawyer raised the alarm last summer at the energy trader about off-balance-sheet partnerships that helped drive it into bankruptcy, said Internet media company Salon.com on Friday. \nAccording to Salon.com, an Enron staff lawyer named Jordan Mintz, who was worried about the legality of the partnerships, last summer hired an outside law firm to review the complex partnerships without Enron's knowledge.\nThe law firm, Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, recommended to Mintz that Enron should stop setting up the shell partnerships, Salon.com said, citing Enron sources. \nThe New York law firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to Enron executives urging the company to halt the practice. Salon.com said Enron apparently followed the advice. \nMinz declined to comment when contacted late Wednesday, citing attorney-client privilege, and Fried Frank did not return a telephone call, Salon.com said. \nThe partnerships allowed Enron to keep debt off its books, gain higher credit ratings and help boost the company's profile among investors. Concerns about the murky partnerships led investors to dump Enron shares after the company reported its first quarterly loss in four years in October and later reduced its earnings over the same period by about $600 million. Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, the biggest in U.S. history.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nEnron CEO under fire again \nReport: Lay knew of accounting problems when he exercised options. \n\nNEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Documents say that Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay sold shares of the energy trader's stock after receiving a letter warning of an accounting problem, according to a published report Friday.\n\nThe Arthur Andersen internal memos, including a letter from employee Sherron Watkins mentioning a meeting with Lay, were released yesterday by Congress, according to the New York Times. Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, is also under investigation for its accounting methods in the case.\n\nSeparately, another report emerged late Thursday that Enron corporate lawyer, Jordan Mintz, hired law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson last summer to take another look at Enron's financial structure. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt worked at the law firm until last fall.\n\nFried Frank recommended that Enron end its partnership deals, Salon.com said.\n\nThe letter from Watkins, written Aug. 15, said she had scheduled a meeting with Lay on Aug. 20 to discuss the accounting issues. Lay exercised options on 93,620 shares for $2 million on Aug. 20 and Aug. 21, the report said.\n\nWhile Lay did not report selling the shares, worth $3.5 million at the time, Enron officials said earlier this week that some of the money went to repay a loan, according to the Times.\n\nCorporate stock sales must be disclosed by the tenth of the month in which the sale takes place, unless the shares are turned over to the company to repay a loan, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's collapse. The firm's bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2 was the largest in U.S. history.\n\nThousands of employees lost their pensions and life's savings in the former Wall Street darling's downfall, which began last autumn when the firm acknowledged several hundred million dollars of previously undisclosed liabilities.\n\nThe saga has also embroiled Andersen, whose reviews of Enron's finances have come under heavy fire amid the firm's admission that employees destroyed a large number of e-mails and documents related to an audit of the energy trader.  \n \n\nEnron Attorney Asks Judge to Approve Sale of Energy-Trading Operations\nBy Kathy Chu\n\n01/18/2002\nDow Jones Business News\n(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\n\nDow Jones Newswires \nNEW YORK -- An Enron Corp. attorney implored a federal judge here to approve the sale of its energy-trading operations to UBS AG in order to bring a \"failed\" business \"back to life.\"\nMartin Bienenstock, of Weil Gotshal & Manges, which represents the bankrupt energy company, said the core operation -- which generated about 90% of Enron's (ENRNQ) $101 billion in revenue last year -- may lose its value if the deal isn't closed soon. \nIf the sale isn't approved, 600 traders and back-office staff could leave in the near future, taking their knowledge of the business with them, according to Steve Zelin, a senior managing partner in Blackstone Group's restructuring division. Blackstone serves as Enron's financial adviser in the deal. \nUnder the deal with UBS (UBS), Enron could get more than $2 billion in royalties and other payments, according to Mr. Zelin, assuming that the Swiss bank eventually exercises a buyout option of the bankrupt company's profit stake. \nUBS, which has agreed to pay Enron 33% of the trading business' pretax royalties for at least two years, may be able to satisfy part of its commitment by issuing debt to Enron. \nThe liquidation value of the trading operations is $40 million to $50 million, said Mr. Zelin. \nWrite to Kathy Chu at kathy.chu@dowjones.com \nCopyright (c) 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. \nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. \t\n\nRuling on Enron sale expected Friday\nEnron fires Andersen as auditor \nBy Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com\nLast Update: 8:35 AM ET Jan. 18, 2002\nNEW YORK (CBS.MW) - A bankruptcy court judge is expected to rule Friday morning on whether Enron's plan to sell its energy trading assets to investment bank UBS Warburg can go forward.\nThe ruling is expects some time after 11 AM Eastern time from judge Arthur Gonzalez, of the Federal Bankruptcy court in Manhattan.\nThe meeting was originally scheduled for Thursday, but was bumped back a day after Enron and UBS requested more time to put together details of the proposed sale .\nOn Thursday, Enron fired its auditor, Andersen, citing the accounting firm's destruction of documents related to the energy company's finances. \nSeparately, Andersen confirmed some details of a meeting in Feb. 2001 at which partners in the accounting firm debated continuing to serve as Enron's auditor despite concerns over limited partnerships formed by the energy company. \nAttorney Robert Bennett said Enron notified Andersen of the firing Thursday afternoon. \"We're very troubled about the destruction of the documents, and we're very concerned about the accounting advice we got,\" Bennett told the Associated Press. \nLate Thursday Andersen issued a news release confirming the February meeting at which Enron's limited partnerships were discussed. Andersen said the meeting was part of a routine review of risks and that no evidence of illegal actions or improper accounting was suspected during the meeting, or in a subsequent memo describing the discussions. \nEnron's formation of limited partnerships helped the company move high levels of debt off its books, improving the company's balance sheet. \nEarlier Thursday a federal judge overseeing all Enron lawsuits in Houston said she will hold a hearing Tuesday in connection with how and why Andersen destroyed Enron-related documents. \nJudge Melinda Harmon replaced Judge Lee Rosenthal this week. Rosenthal recused herself from the Enron cases with no explanation. She once was a partner at the law firm Baker & Botts, which is representing Dynegy, whose 2001 plan to merge with Enron was aborted. \nHarmon will hear Amalgamated Bank's request for expedited discovery and will consider a motion for a temporary restraining order prohibiting Andersen from destroying evidence. Andersen said it has ordered a halt to the destruction of any Enron-related documents. \nAndersen fired the man who served as its lead Enron auditor Tuesday.\nDavid Duncan, the fired Andersen partner, met Wednesday with staff and attorneys for the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He denied any wrongdoing. \nAlso on Thursday, House investigators requested that Andersen hand over additional notes or records from the 14 participants in a meeting five months ago into potential accounting landmines at Enron in a meeting five months ago. \nAmalgamated Bank is suing 29 Enron officers and directors along with Andersen for $25 billion in damages, alleging that the defendants sold more than $1 billion worth of shares while misrepresenting the financial state of the company. \nLisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com.\n\n\nCheney discussed Enron with Indian leader\n\nJanuary 18, 2002 Posted: 12:50 PM EST (1750 GMT)\n\nBy John King\nCNN Washington Bureau \n\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- Vice President Dick Cheney asked Indian opposition leader Sonia Gandhi last June about a multimillion-dollar debt owed to Enron from a major energy project in India, administration officials confirmed Friday. \nThe officials told CNN the subject came up for only a moment at a meeting at the White House, and that no one at Enron asked Cheney to raise the issue. Cheney met with Ghandi to discuss general diplomatic issues affecting the U.S. and India. \nThese two officials also noted that the taxpayer-financed Overseas Private Investment Corporation had a stake in the issue; OPIC could face payouts of perhaps $300 million, because it agreed to underwrite political risk insurance as part of the Enron deal. \nA Cheney aide said the vice president has had three meetings with Indian officials since the Bush administration took office. The $64 million Enron debt has come up just once, in the June 27th meeting with the opposition leader. \nThe aide told CNN that Enron CEO Kenneth Lay \"never asked him to do it, no one at Enron asked him to talk about it. It was in the briefing papers Cheney received in advance of the meeting, and he asked about the status of the Enron project.\" \nThe officials noted the meeting was in June; it was several months later that Enron's financial problems began to surface. \nAdministration officials say there was nothing improper about raising the Enron debt issue. But reports of Cheney's actions come at a time some Democrats in Congress are suggesting Enron benefited from its deep ties with senior Bush administration officials. \nThose Democrats are pressing for information on Enron-administration contacts and any administration actions that might have benefited Enron. \n", "sender": "sarah.palmer@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Mentions -- 01/18/02"}, "op_id": "0e91c184ef", "logical_op_id": "ce36d58df1", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 2.0496809482574463, "cost_per_record": 0.016030000000000003, "source_op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": "FALSE", "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 5920, "total_output_tokens": 123, "total_input_cost": 0.0148, "total_output_cost": 0.0012300000000000002, "filter_str": "The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron", "passed_filter": false, "llm_call_duration_secs": 2.047116994857788, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "filter": "Filter(The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron)"}}, {"record_id": "9a700ccc1e", "record_parent_id": "940723163c", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/martin-t-inbox-98-short.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "martin-t-inbox-98-short.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <28543449.1075841171541.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Fri, 18 Jan 2002 09:52:41 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nTo: sarah.palmer@enron.com\nSubject: Enron Mentions -- 01/18/02\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\nX-From: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SPALME2>\nX-To: Palmer, Sarah </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Spalme2>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\ExMerge - Martin, Thomas A.\\Inbox\nX-Origin: MARTIN-T\nX-FileName: tom martin 6-25-02.PST\n\n\nEnron Letter Writer Worked At Key Partnership Early On\nDow Jones Energy Service, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron's Chief Sold Shares After Receiving Warning Letter\nThe New York Times, 01/18/2002\n\nA look at Thursday's developments involving Enron\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron fires Andersen=20\nBoard takes action as new facts surface=20\nHouston Chronicle, 01/18/2002\nIn Enron Leaders, Seeing the Worst Of Ourselves\nThe Washington Post, 01/18/2002\n\nBroadband-unit hype didn't match reality=20\nHouston Chronicle, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron chairman selling 2 homes, lot in Colorado for $16.2 million=20\nHouston Chronicle, 01/18/2002\n\nBlockbuster deal helped sow seeds of Enron fiasco CIBC World Markets agreed=\n to invest $115.2-million in affiliated partnership\nWall Street Journal,  01/18/2002\n\nDeals That Helped Doom Enron Began to Form in the Early 90's\nThe New York Times, 01/18/2002\n\nEnron deals that led to collapse began in early 1990s - report\nAFX News, 01/18/2002\n\nAndersen HQ 'discussed Enron purge'.\nFinancial Times, 01/18/2002\n\nAttorneys for Enron assure judge more documents won't be shredded\nAssociated Press Newswires, 01/18/2002\n\nWhen Rules Keep Debt Off the Books --- Did Andersen Act Properly?

The value in the swaps won't\n> be there for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to offset these\n> losses. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the layman on the\nstreet\n> that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that\n> company with Enron stock in the future.\n> I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting\n> scandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on\nmy\n> r?sum?, the business world will consider the past successes as nothing\nbut\n> an elaborate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for \"personal\n> reasons\" but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down the road and\n> knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now than\n> resign in shame in two years.\n> Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I have\n> thought and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into one\n> big problem - we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and 2000, we\n> enjoyed wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold stock, we then\n> try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit like robbing the\n> bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later. Nice try, but\n> investors were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a share looking for $120\na\n> share and now they're at $38 or worse. We are under too much scrutiny and\n> there are probably one or two disgruntled \"redeployed\" employees who know\n> enough about the \"funny\" accounting to get us in trouble.\n> What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in the\n> all-employee meeting, but can you give some assurances that you and\nCausey\n> will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is going to\n> happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003?\n> Summary of Alleged Issues:\n>\n> RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at risk;\n> however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM.\n> If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is no\n> commitment to contribute more equity.\n> The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form of\n> Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.\n> Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptor\n> entities locking in our values for various equity investments we hold.\n> As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the\n> equity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying\n> securities.\n> This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying\n> capitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing\n> for reserves against our MTM positions.\n> To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we \"enhanced\"\n> the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing more ENE shares.\n> My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must \"enhance\"\n> the vehicles by $250 million.\n> I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and a\nlot\n> of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting treatment.\n> None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed\n> in the bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's problems of\nWaste\n> Management (news/quote\n>\n</redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custo\n> m/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=WMI>) - where AA paid $130 million\n> plus in litigation re questionable accounting practices.)\n> The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain the\n> \"accounting treatment\" to a man in the street, would you influence his\n> investing decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on a thorough\n> understanding of the facts? If so, you best present it correctly and/or\n> change the accounting.\n> My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the\n> transactions. If adequately explained, the investor would know that the\n> \"entities\" described in our related party footnote are thinly\ncapitalized,\n> the equity holders have no skin in the game, and all the value in the\n> entities comes from the underlying value of the derivatives\n(unfortunately\n> in this case, a big loss) AND Enron stock and N/P. Looking at the stock\nwe\n> swapped, I also don't believe any other company would have entered into\n> the equity derivative transactions with us at the same prices or without\n> substantial premiums from Enron. In other words, the $500 million in\n> revenue in 2000 would have been much lower. How much lower?\n> Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well, then no\n> one would be the wiser. If Enron stock did well, the stock issuance to\n> these entities would decline and the transactions would be less\n> noticeable. All has gone against us. The stocks, most notably Hanover,\nthe\n> New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser degrees.\n> I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a\n> clear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the\n> transactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities\nlaw\n> and accounting. I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for himself\n> what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the estimated\n> damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one of two\n> courses of action:\n> 1. The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated damage\ntoo\n> great; therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly reverse, unwind,\n> write down these positions/transactions.\n> 2. The probability of discovery is too great, the estimated damages to\nthe\n> company too great; therefore, we must quantify, develop damage\ncontainment\n> plans and disclose.\n> I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly\nincreased\n> with Skilling's shocking departure. Too many people are looking for a\n> smoking gun.\n> Summary of Raptor Oddities:\n> 1. The accounting treatment looks questionable.\n> a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a\nrelated\n> party.\n> b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk except\n> Enron.\n> c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a\n> contribution of its own shares.\n> One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in its\n> equity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I can't\n> find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who will\nlose\n> this money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party entity?\n> If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact\npattern\n> that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors.\n> 2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms length.\n> a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party at\n> what now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici have\n> fallen away significantly since. The related party was unable to lay off\n> this risk. This fact pattern is once again very negative for Enron.\n> b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into\nthese\n> transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was the\n> compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such\n> transactions?\n> 3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees question\n> our accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This alone is cause\n> for concern.\n> a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM. He\n> complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought\n> should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later,\n> Skilling offered him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Markets and\nnever\n> addressed the five steps with him.\n> b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen\n> about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM.\n> c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal investments\n> group say, \"I know it would be devastating to all of us, but I wish we\n> would get caught. We're such a crooked company.\" The principal\ninvestments\n> group hedged a large number of their investments with Raptor. These\npeople\n> know and see a lot. Many similar comments are made when you ask about\n> these deals. Employees quote our C.F.O. as saying that he has a handshake\n> deal with Skilling that LJM will never lose money.\n> 4. Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the money\n> trail between Enron and LJM/Raptor and its principals? Can he look at\nLJM?\n> At Raptor? If the C.F.O. says no, isn't that a problem?\n> Condor and Raptor Work:\n", "sender": "gregory.schockling@enron.com", "subject": "FW: E memo"}, "op_id": "0e91c184ef", "logical_op_id": "ce36d58df1", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 3.7827677726745605, "cost_per_record": 0.009747500000000001, "source_op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": "TRUE", "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 3259, "total_output_tokens": 160, "total_input_cost": 0.0081475, "total_output_cost": 0.0016, "filter_str": "The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron", "passed_filter": true, "llm_call_duration_secs": 3.7795190811157227, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "filter": "Filter(The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron)"}}, {"record_id": "33f0abada3", "record_parent_id": "0288ac8ab8", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/skilling-j-inbox-1109.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "skilling-j-inbox-1109.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <16177083.1075852671497.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 25 Sep 2001 15:39:29 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: gary@cioclub.com\nTo: jeff.skilling@enron.com\nSubject: Information Security Executive\n                                  -092501\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Gary@CIOClub.com@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-Gary+40CIOClub+2Ecom+40ENRON@ENRON.com>\nX-To: Skilling, Jeff </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JSKILLIN>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JSKILLIN (Non-Privileged)\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Dasovich-J\nX-FileName: JDASOVIC (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nDear Jeff,\n\nThis will introduce an outstanding Information Security Executive who is available in the near term through the CIO Club.\n\nExecutive Summary:\n15 years of management experience in the planning, design, development, and implementation  of information security policies, controls, services and  systems.

The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu.\nThe market dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the\nsession between $2.10 - $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as\nlocals sold down the contract to the $2.07 support level and went home\nshort. The AGA will release this week's storage report this afternoon, and\nwhile some traders are predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf\nwithdrawal, look for the number to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in\nthe Midwest and Texas, the growing differential between cash and futures,\nand the perceived premium in the early March contract have kept the market\nfrom dropping further. Physical prices retained their premium over futures\nyesterday on short-term cold weather at some pipelines, maintaining about\na $0.07 - $0.10 premium over the NYMEX. But cash traders expect the demand\nto ease quickly as temperatures moderate by this weekend. As usual, the\nmarket will look to the weekly storage report for short term direction,\nbut it is the massive amount of volumes still in storage compared to last\nyear that has put a cap on longer term price increases.

In\ntestimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that\nEnron had a $500 million loss in March. Rather than report it to\nshareholders, Enron gave a partnership called Raptor another $800 million\nin Enron shares. He said that there is no doubt that almost everyone, from\nthe board of directors on down, knew that the company was attempting to\noffset investment losses with stock. The partnerships allowed Enron to\nmisrepresent earnings for a period spanning the 3rd quarter of 2000\nthrough the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers told that committee\nthat over 70% of Enron's earnings for that period were false. He said that\nthere were red flags that should have alerted former chairman Ken Lay to\nwhat was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely understood that Enron\nwas using its own stock to offset the losses in the partnerships.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFAST.

This was a good price (average price LTM of 37p), but was below the quarter end price.  Therefore, there is a Q3 loss of $6.4 million.  Andrew Marsden is managing this in London.\nCompleted all requirements to sell COPEL shares (a $100+ million investment in the Brazilian utility).  Began selling shares on 7/17.  Current price is approximately $14 million below carrying value of approximately $120 million.  Likely to take a couple of months to exit entire position.  Investment is carried as \"Strategic\", and any losses upon the sale will fall \"below the line\" in the sale of non-merchant asset line.  Steven Sheldon is managing this.\nCompleted negotiations on the sale of Utiliquest for $62.5 million.  Should sign on Thursday.  Enron had invested $11.6 million in cash (net of JEDI II) and will receive $14.3 million.  The sale will net a cash gain to Enron, but below our carrying value of $16.3 million, yielding a $2 million accounting loss.  Kevin Kuykendall is managing this.\nFinalized processes to begin selling Hanover Compressor shares.  We own 4.6 million shares, which are trading at $30.00/share for a total value of $138 million.  Hanover has been hedged through Raptor.  However, the structure that was used to hedge is a costless collar that leaves Enron exposed below $34.875/share.  Therefore, at current trading levels we are facing a $23 million loss.  We are working with CSFB, which has proposed to execute a block trade sale.  However, the stock continues to decline each day, and CSFB will not make an offer until the price stabilizes.  If we have to sell at a block discount, or if the price continues to fall we could be facing a $35 million to $40 million loss.  Needless to say, we are very focused on this investment.\nLosses from Venture Capital positions appear to be approximately $10 million for Q3, which is primarily the result of write-offs in the HEOF portfolio.\nNet quarterly expectations: Cash proceeds received from sales - ~$250 million, losses from sales below carrying value ~$60 million ($46 million \"above the line\" and $14 million \"below the line\").  \n\nIntegration\nAll personnel decisions made.\nLegal (Gil Melman), RAC (Randy Petersen), accounting (Hope Vargas), HR (Sheila Walton) and Tax (Jim Sandt) support personnel determined.\nEveryone moving to same location (EB36) today.\nPreparation of 2nd half 2001 budget (revenue and expense) still in process.  To be completed by 7/31.\nBack office systems and filing systems in process of integration.  To be completed by 7/31.\n\nProcess Standardization\nMid stream of development of deal filtering, deal evaluation and due diligence, modeling, approval, portfolio management, and exit (all to be completed by 8/15).\nNeed to develop permanent approval process, including approval limits.\n\nStrategy Development\nStrategy is currently being vetted through a collaborative process including all senior members of the group and RAC.\nFinal drafting session for 5-7 page strategy/charter paper and 10 page powerpoint presentation scheduled for July 27.\nPresentation of strategy to Greg and Ken is scheduled for July 30, to Jeff Skilling on August 15.\n\nOther Issues\nGiven Andy Fastow's involvement with Corp Dev, and our groups need for capital, I would like to add Andy to the Investment Committee.  Please provide feedback.\n\nThanks,\nKG\n\n", "sender": "kevin.garland@enron.com", "subject": "Enron Principal Investments Update"}, "op_id": "0e91c184ef", "logical_op_id": "ce36d58df1", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 2.4717419147491455, "cost_per_record": 0.004635, "source_op_id": "f1ce8060c5", "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": "TRUE", "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 1402, "total_output_tokens": 113, "total_input_cost": 0.0035050000000000003, "total_output_cost": 0.0011300000000000001, "filter_str": "The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron", "passed_filter": true, "llm_call_duration_secs": 2.4701478481292725, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "filter": "Filter(The email is not quoting from a news article or an article written by someone outside of Enron)"}}, {"record_id": "2cd4582944", "record_parent_id": "3f17ad2604", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/zipper-a-espeed-28.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "zipper-a-espeed-28.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <19460654.1075851675082.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Wed, 29 Nov 2000 11:34:00 -0800 (PST)\nFrom: travis.mccullough@enron.com\nTo: andy.zipper@enron.com\nSubject: Redraft of the Exclusivity Agreement\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Travis McCullough\nX-To: Andy Zipper\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\Andrew_Zipper_Nov2001\\Notes Folders\\Espeed\nX-Origin: ZIPPER-A\nX-FileName: azipper.nsf\n\nHeard the Skilling meeting was postponed.

I wasn't trying to be critical of anyone specifically, and I think Dick is doing an admirable job.  I will give him high marks at PRC.  However, one position that has lost a significant amount of value since we were free to sell it is Avici.  Do you think that at PRC, this \"loss\" of value, which does not show up in a P/L since it is hedged by Raptor, should be taken into account when we evaluate the person?  My point is only that each of these investments are \"positions\" that should be \"owned\" by someone, like a book.  Hickerson didn't get evaluated on Avici because it didn't show up in a P/L (even though he lost a lot of value).  What do we do with Garland?  Now it has lost a lot of value again.  If Dick could sell an asset for a 10% loss today, but doesn't, and we eventually lose 30% upon disposition, how do you evaluate the performance?\n\nAndy  \n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tLavorato, John  \nSent:\tTuesday, April 03, 2001 11:09 AM\nTo:\tFastow, Andrew S.\nCc:\tKitchen, Louise\nSubject:\t\n\nAndy\n\nWith respect to North America, Dick Lydecker is liquidating most of the raptor assets.

The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu. The mark=\net dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the session bet=\nween $2.10  $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as locals sold down =\nthe contract to the $2.07 support level and went home short. The AGA will r=\nelease this weeks storage report this afternoon, and while some traders are=\n predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf withdrawal, look for the numbe=\nr to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in the Midwest and Texas, the growi=\nng differential between cash and futures, and the perceived premium in the =\nearly March contract have kept the market from dropping further. Physical p=\nrices retained their premium over futures yesterday on short-term cold weat=\nher at some pipelines, maintaining about a $0.07  $0.10 premium over the NY=\nMEX. But cash traders expect the demand to ease quickly as temperatures mod=\nerate by t! his weekend. As usual, the market will look to the weekly stora=\nge report for short term direction, but it is the massive amount of volumes=\n still in storage compared to last year that has put a cap on longer term p=\nrice increases. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada =\nwas generally flat to plus or minus a few cents yesterday. Natural gas for =\nnext day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.02 to $2.20 per MMBtu.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nExploit the enterprise-wide transaction management power deployed by the\nbig names in gas.\nNUCLEUS Software\nZAINET Gasmaster\nThe most comprehensive, totally-integrated natural gas information system\navailable today.\nAsk about out limited-time offer competitive upgrade program.\nCAMINUS\nYour Competitive Edge in Energy.\nCall Caminus at (212)515-3700 or visit the website at http://www.caminus.co=\nm=20\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nToday's Power Bulletins\n* Ameren 4th Quarter Earnings Jump 19% as Increased Electricity Sales Offse=\nt Lower Prices\n* In Wake of Enron Collapse, Senate Energy Committee Takes 2nd Look at Publ=\nic Utility Holding Company Act at Hearing Today\n* California Senate Energy Committees Plans Hearing on ISOs Market Design P=\nlan for 2002; Members Have Serious Doubts About ISOs Ability to Enforce Mar=\nket Rules Going Forward\n* Allegheny Energy Files Shelf to Sell Up to $1.5 Billion in Common Stock, =\nPreferred Securities, Debt Securities, Warrants, Contracts, Units and Trust=\ns\n* Unitil Cuts New Hampshire Electric Rates to Lowest in Region\n* El Paso Completes 172 MW Expansion of Linden NJ Power Plant\n* Centennial Power Acquires Rocky Mountain Power\n* Duke/Fluor Daniel to Build 875 MW Power Plant for South Carolina Electric=\n & Gas\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nDO YOU JUST SEE TREES?

In testimony before the House Ene=\nrgy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that Enron had a $500 million loss =\nin March. Rather than report it to shareholders, Enron gave a partnership c=\nalled Raptor another $800 million in Enron shares. He said that there is no=\n doubt that almost everyone, from the board of directors on down, knew that=\n the company was attempting to offset investment losses with stock. The par=\ntnerships allowed Enron to misrepresent earnings for a period spanning the =\n3rd quarter of 2000 through the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers t=\nold that committee that over 70% of Enrons earnings for that period were fa=\nlse. He said that there were red flags that should have alerted former chai=\nrman Ken L! ay to what was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely under=\nstood that Enron was using its own stock to offset the losses in the partne=\nrships.=20\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFAST.

Skilling\n> resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its author was later\n> identified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president for corporate\n> development at Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committee released\n> excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday:\n\n\n> Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn't get\n> rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay?\n> Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting\n> improprieties and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive in its\n> accounting - most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condor vehicle.\n> We do have valuation issues with our international assets and possibly\n> some of our EES MTM positions.\n> The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept that Skilling\nis\n> leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues can be fixed and\n> reported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002. How do we fix\n> the Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003, we will have\nto\n> pony up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed.\n> To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized funds flow\nof\n> $800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to a vehicle\n> (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock in later\nyears.\n> Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equity issuance?\n> We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocks via\nour\n> swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly - Avici\n> by 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New Power Company by\n> 80 percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in the swaps won't\n> be there for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock to offset these\n> losses. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to the layman on the\nstreet\n> that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that\n> company with Enron stock in the future.\n> I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting\n> scandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on\nmy\n> r?sum?, the business world will consider the past successes as nothing\nbut\n> an elaborate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for \"personal\n> reasons\" but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked down the road and\n> knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now than\n> resign in shame in two years.\n> Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? I have\n> thought and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping into one\n> big problem - we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and 2000, we\n> enjoyed wonderfully high stock price, many executives sold stock, we then\n> try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bit like robbing the\n> bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later. Nice try, but\n> investors were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 a share looking for $120\na\n> share and now they're at $38 or worse. We are under too much scrutiny and\n> there are probably one or two disgruntled \"redeployed\" employees who know\n> enough about the \"funny\" accounting to get us in trouble.\n> What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in the\n> all-employee meeting, but can you give some assurances that you and\nCausey\n> will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what is going to\n> happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003?\n> Summary of Alleged Issues:\n>\n> RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is at risk;\n> however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paid to LJM.\n> If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there is no\n> commitment to contribute more equity.\n> The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is some form of\n> Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights.\n> Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with the Raptor\n> entities locking in our values for various equity investments we hold.\n> As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from the\n> equity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlying\n> securities.\n> This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlying\n> capitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushing\n> for reserves against our MTM positions.\n> To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we \"enhanced\"\n> the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committing more ENE shares.\n> My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must \"enhance\"\n> the vehicles by $250 million.\n> I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this and a\nlot\n> of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accounting treatment.\n> None of that will protect Enron if these transactions are ever disclosed\n> in the bright light of day. (Please review the late 90's problems of\nWaste\n> Management (news/quote\n>\n</redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custo\n> m/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=WMI>) - where AA paid $130 million\n> plus in litigation re questionable accounting practices.)\n> The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explain the\n> \"accounting treatment\" to a man in the street, would you influence his\n> investing decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on a thorough\n> understanding of the facts? If so, you best present it correctly and/or\n> change the accounting.\n> My concern is that the footnotes don't adequately explain the\n> transactions. If adequately explained, the investor would know that the\n> \"entities\" described in our related party footnote are thinly\ncapitalized,\n> the equity holders have no skin in the game, and all the value in the\n> entities comes from the underlying value of the derivatives\n(unfortunately\n> in this case, a big loss) AND Enron stock and N/P. Looking at the stock\nwe\n> swapped, I also don't believe any other company would have entered into\n> the equity derivative transactions with us at the same prices or without\n> substantial premiums from Enron. In other words, the $500 million in\n> revenue in 2000 would have been much lower. How much lower?\n> Raptor looks to be a big bet if the underlying stocks did well, then no\n> one would be the wiser. If Enron stock did well, the stock issuance to\n> these entities would decline and the transactions would be less\n> noticeable. All has gone against us. The stocks, most notably Hanover,\nthe\n> New Power Company and Avici are underwater to great or lesser degrees.\n> I firmly believe that executive management of the company must have a\n> clear and precise knowledge of these transactions and they must have the\n> transactions reviewed by objective experts in the fields of securities\nlaw\n> and accounting. I believe Ken Lay deserves the right to judge for himself\n> what he believes the probabilities of discovery to be and the estimated\n> damages to the company from those discoveries and decide one of two\n> courses of action:\n> 1. The probability of discovery is low enough and the estimated damage\ntoo\n> great; therefore we find a way to quietly and quickly reverse, unwind,\n> write down these positions/transactions.\n> 2. The probability of discovery is too great, the estimated damages to\nthe\n> company too great; therefore, we must quantify, develop damage\ncontainment\n> plans and disclose.\n> I firmly believe that the probability of discovery significantly\nincreased\n> with Skilling's shocking departure. Too many people are looking for a\n> smoking gun.\n> Summary of Raptor Oddities:\n> 1. The accounting treatment looks questionable.\n> a. Enron booked a $500 million gain from equity derivatives from a\nrelated\n> party.\n> b. That related party is thinly capitalized with no party at risk except\n> Enron.\n> c. It appears Enron has supported an income statement gain by a\n> contribution of its own shares.\n> One basic question: The related party entity has lost $500 million in its\n> equity derivative transactions with Enron. Who bears that loss? I can't\n> find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss. Find out who will\nlose\n> this money. Who will pay for this loss at the related party entity?\n> If it's Enron, from our shares, then I think we do not have a fact\npattern\n> that would look good to the S.E.C. or investors.\n> 2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at arms length.\n> a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related party at\n> what now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avici have\n> fallen away significantly since. The related party was unable to lay off\n> this risk. This fact pattern is once again very negative for Enron.\n> b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered into\nthese\n> transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What was the\n> compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into such\n> transactions?\n> 3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employees question\n> our accounting propriety consistently and constantly. This alone is cause\n> for concern.\n> a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM. He\n> complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought\n> should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later,\n> Skilling offered him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Markets and\nnever\n> addressed the five steps with him.\n> b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen\n> about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM.\n> c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principal investments\n> group say, \"I know it would be devastating to all of us, but I wish we\n> would get caught. We're such a crooked company.\" The principal\ninvestments\n> group hedged a large number of their investments with Raptor. These\npeople\n> know and see a lot. Many similar comments are made when you ask about\n> these deals. Employees quote our C.F.O. as saying that he has a handshake\n> deal with Skilling that LJM will never lose money.\n> 4. Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and the money\n> trail between Enron and LJM/Raptor and its principals? Can he look at\nLJM?\n> At Raptor? If the C.F.O. says no, isn't that a problem?\n> Condor and Raptor Work:\n", "sender": "gregory.schockling@enron.com", "subject": "FW: E memo"}, "op_id": "95b3d516b6", "logical_op_id": "5456548e60", "op_name": "LLMFilter", "time_per_record": 1.9070100784301758, "cost_per_record": 0.009152500000000001, "source_op_id": "0e91c184ef", "plan_id": "285c3a5cb2", "quality": null, "model_name": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "answer": "TRUE", "input_fields": null, "generated_fields": null, "total_input_tokens": 3269, "total_output_tokens": 98, "total_input_cost": 0.008172500000000001, "total_output_cost": 0.0009800000000000002, "filter_str": "The email refers to a fraudulent scheme (i.e., \"Raptor\", \"Deathstar\", \"Chewco\", and/or \"Fat Boy\")", "passed_filter": true, "llm_call_duration_secs": 1.9056980609893799, "fn_call_duration_secs": 0.0, "failed_convert": null, "image_operation": false, "op_details": {"model": "Model.GPT_4o", "outputSchema": "Email(contents, filename, sender, subject)", "filter": "Filter(The email refers to a fraudulent scheme (i.e., \"Raptor\", \"Deathstar\", \"Chewco\", and/or \"Fat Boy\"))"}}, {"record_id": "7cde38ba51", "record_parent_id": "33f0abada3", "record_source_id": "/Users/siva/Desktop/palimpzest/testdata/enron-eval/skilling-j-inbox-1109.txt", "record_state": {"filename": "skilling-j-inbox-1109.txt", "contents": "Message-ID: <16177083.1075852671497.JavaMail.evans@thyme>\nDate: Tue, 25 Sep 2001 15:39:29 -0700 (PDT)\nFrom: gary@cioclub.com\nTo: jeff.skilling@enron.com\nSubject: Information Security Executive\n                                  -092501\nMime-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\nX-From: Gary@CIOClub.com@ENRON <IMCEANOTES-Gary+40CIOClub+2Ecom+40ENRON@ENRON.com>\nX-To: Skilling, Jeff </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JSKILLIN>\nX-cc: \nX-bcc: \nX-Folder: \\JSKILLIN (Non-Privileged)\\Inbox\nX-Origin: Dasovich-J\nX-FileName: JDASOVIC (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nDear Jeff,\n\nThis will introduce an outstanding Information Security Executive who is available in the near term through the CIO Club.\n\nExecutive Summary:\n15 years of management experience in the planning, design, development, and implementation  of information security policies, controls, services and  systems.

The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu.\nThe market dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the\nsession between $2.10 - $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as\nlocals sold down the contract to the $2.07 support level and went home\nshort. The AGA will release this week's storage report this afternoon, and\nwhile some traders are predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf\nwithdrawal, look for the number to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in\nthe Midwest and Texas, the growing differential between cash and futures,\nand the perceived premium in the early March contract have kept the market\nfrom dropping further. Physical prices retained their premium over futures\nyesterday on short-term cold weather at some pipelines, maintaining about\na $0.07 - $0.10 premium over the NYMEX. But cash traders expect the demand\nto ease quickly as temperatures moderate by this weekend. As usual, the\nmarket will look to the weekly storage report for short term direction,\nbut it is the massive amount of volumes still in storage compared to last\nyear that has put a cap on longer term price increases. Natural gas for\nnext day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to plus or\nminus a few cents yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the\nHenry hub gained $0.02 to $2.20 per MMBtu.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n Exploit the enterprise-wide transaction management power deployed by the\nbig names in gas.\nNUCLEUS Software\nZAINET Gasmaster\nThe most comprehensive, totally-integrated natural gas information system\navailable today.\nAsk about out limited-time offer competitive upgrade program.\nCAMINUS\nYour Competitive Edge in Energy.\nCall Caminus at (212)515-3700 or visit the website at\nhttp://www.caminus.com\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nToday's Power Bulletins\n * Ameren 4th Quarter Earnings Jump 19% as Increased Electricity Sales\nOffset Lower Prices\n * In Wake of Enron Collapse, Senate Energy Committee Takes 2nd Look at\nPublic Utility Holding Company Act at Hearing Today\n * California Senate Energy Committee's Plans Hearing on ISO's Market\nDesign Plan for 2002; Members Have Serious Doubts About ISO's Ability to\nEnforce Market Rules Going Forward\n * Allegheny Energy Files Shelf to Sell Up to $1.5 Billion in Common\nStock, Preferred Securities, Debt Securities, Warrants, Contracts, Units\nand Trusts\n * Unitil Cuts New Hampshire Electric Rates to Lowest in Region\n * El Paso Completes 172 MW Expansion of Linden NJ Power Plant\n * Centennial Power Acquires Rocky Mountain Power\n * Duke/Fluor Daniel to Build 875 MW Power Plant for South Carolina\nElectric & Gas\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nDO YOU JUST SEE TREES?

In\ntestimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that\nEnron had a $500 million loss in March. Rather than report it to\nshareholders, Enron gave a partnership called Raptor another $800 million\nin Enron shares. He said that there is no doubt that almost everyone, from\nthe board of directors on down, knew that the company was attempting to\noffset investment losses with stock. The partnerships allowed Enron to\nmisrepresent earnings for a period spanning the 3rd quarter of 2000\nthrough the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers told that committee\nthat over 70% of Enron's earnings for that period were false. He said that\nthere were red flags that should have alerted former chairman Ken Lay to\nwhat was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely understood that Enron\nwas using its own stock to offset the losses in the partnerships.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFAST.

This was a good price (average price LTM of 37p), but was below the quarter end price.  Therefore, there is a Q3 loss of $6.4 million.  Andrew Marsden is managing this in London.\nCompleted all requirements to sell COPEL shares (a $100+ million investment in the Brazilian utility).  Began selling shares on 7/17.  Current price is approximately $14 million below carrying value of approximately $120 million.  Likely to take a couple of months to exit entire position.  Investment is carried as \"Strategic\", and any losses upon the sale will fall \"below the line\" in the sale of non-merchant asset line.  Steven Sheldon is managing this.\nCompleted negotiations on the sale of Utiliquest for $62.5 million.  Should sign on Thursday.  Enron had invested $11.6 million in cash (net of JEDI II) and will receive $14.3 million.  The sale will net a cash gain to Enron, but below our carrying value of $16.3 million, yielding a $2 million accounting loss.  Kevin Kuykendall is managing this.\nFinalized processes to begin selling Hanover Compressor shares.  We own 4.6 million shares, which are trading at $30.00/share for a total value of $138 million.  Hanover has been hedged through Raptor.  However, the structure that was used to hedge is a costless collar that leaves Enron exposed below $34.875/share.  Therefore, at current trading levels we are facing a $23 million loss.  We are working with CSFB, which has proposed to execute a block trade sale.  However, the stock continues to decline each day, and CSFB will not make an offer until the price stabilizes.  If we have to sell at a block discount, or if the price continues to fall we could be facing a $35 million to $40 million loss.  Needless to say, we are very focused on this investment.\nLosses from Venture Capital positions appear to be approximately $10 million for Q3, which is primarily the result of write-offs in the HEOF portfolio.\nNet quarterly expectations: Cash proceeds received from sales - ~$250 million, losses from sales below carrying value ~$60 million ($46 million \"above the line\" and $14 million \"below the line\").  \n\nIntegration\nAll personnel decisions made.\nLegal (Gil Melman), RAC (Randy Petersen), accounting (Hope Vargas), HR (Sheila Walton) and Tax (Jim Sandt) support personnel determined.\nEveryone moving to same location (EB36) today.\nPreparation of 2nd half 2001 budget (revenue and expense) still in process.

The redline\nshows changes from the draft submitted to us by eSpeed.\n\n Per our earlier conversation, you said that Andy was still thinking\nabout one open point, namely: Whether the definition of the Enron Platform\nshould be modified to anticipate some changes that may occur.  Specifically\nI suggested that the requirement that the Enron Platform be \"operated\" by an\nEnron Party be deleted, and leaving only the limitation of ownership.\n\n I have given Anthony comments on the series designation.  He will be\nmaking other changes to the designation and will forward it to you directly.\n\n Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, or if I\ncan be of any further assistance.\n\n Best regards,\n\n Ted\n          ++++++CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE+++++\nThe information in this email may be confidential and/or privileged.
