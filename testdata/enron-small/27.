Please review the attached letter to ONEOK and the supporting Imbalance Statement, Dollar Valuation Statement and ONEOK PTR Shrink Balance and Interest Calculation detail report.  Once I get the "go-ahead" from you, I will Email this package to Delaine Kurth.

We still prefer to send this package out today, so please get back to me this afternoon if possible.  If we do not hear from everyone, we will still send it to Delaine as someone from each of your staff has already reviewed and agreed to the language in the letter.
Rick
