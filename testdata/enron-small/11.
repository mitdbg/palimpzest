Jim,
Here is another matter I need to really push, a letter demanding payment of the Mt. Jesus condensate reimbursement short payments.  Please review this letter and give me your observations, suggestions. 

Lynn,
Any better name than Spencer to send this to?  

Dan/Mark
Can you get me updated numbers?  Here is a spreadsheet that Debbie provided to me.   


Charlie
