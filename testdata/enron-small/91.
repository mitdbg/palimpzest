	Ken and Kile, 

	Please see the attached proposed draft letter.  I need to fill in one blank, but it is otherwise complete, subject to your thoughts.  I will try and get a copy of Sherry Rogers' letter to Harry Woodson of November 1 by fax to you both.

	Britt

	P.S. to Lynn and Harry:  is it alright with you for Ken to basically be replying to the letter to Harry?  Do we also need a "me, too" letter from Harry?
