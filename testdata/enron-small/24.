Mary, as you requested, on yesterday  I have added January 1998 thru May 1998 affidavit volumes.
I have also made adjustments to June and July 1998 volumes.  I didn't multiply the volumes by
the correct number of days for these two months.  If you have any questions or concerns please 
feel free to give me a call.
