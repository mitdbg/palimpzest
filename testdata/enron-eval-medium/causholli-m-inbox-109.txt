Monika,

Good that you put some analysis with the price changes.  I'd be a bit careful about declaring that prices are expected to continue increasing through November --- many market observers (particularly Mr. Ross Hay-Roe) believe there's a good chance that the US$15/metric ton increase the producers already received will begin to erode in the next few weeks.  I think it's important that we give air time to all the possibilities, especially in light of the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the market.  Thanks.

Karen

Hello,
 
The November FOEX that came out today showed a small up-tick versus last week. 

FOEX for NBSK was US$465.43 up US$0.95 (0.2%)

FOEX for BHKP was Euro 466.02 up only Euro 0.02. In terms of dollars BHKP was US$420.55 up US$4.46 (1.07%).

Even though the movement upwards is very minimal, it is still in line with the pulp producers' attempts to raise prices. The price increases so far have been partially successful as producers have only been able to push for a US$10-15 dollar increase  instead of US$20-30 as previously announced. Still price increases are expected to continue in November. 

Please see attached for a chart on FOEX indeces.   


Thanks,
