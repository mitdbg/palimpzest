John, My copy of this email had no attachment, so I'll have to get it some other way.  I would suggest that we handle employee lawsuits the same way we did in the past, so that if it is a NEPCO claim, it comes to me and Lizzette.  I don't know who had been assisting EPIC in the past.  But, Sharon, Kriste, Lizzette or I will be able to assist in this.  Michelle

Attached for your review is a letter from attorney Bradley Dillard in Tupelo, Mississippi concerning an Enron employee, James A. Meyer.  The attached letter has also been sent via facsimile.

Thank you
