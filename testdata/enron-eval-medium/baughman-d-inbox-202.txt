Dear Investor,

This little biotech company just may have THE ANSWER
to prostate cancer...

...and a lock on one of the largest -- and most
lucrative -- health markets of the Western world.
Best of all, its stock is what I call a  "Why the heck
not" investment.  It's low-priced -- you can pick up a
thousand shares for around $1,200 now.  And it has the
potential to MULTIPLY that small investment 10-to-20
TIMES over in the next couple years.

See why I call it "Why the heck not?"  Just a tiny
amount of risk capital can turn into a really nice
chunk of change.

Frankly, my worst expectations are for a NEAR-TERM
DOUBLE.  That happens and you can even sell half your
position, keep half -- and have none of your original
investment at risk.  Everything after that is gravy!

THAT'S THE BIOTECH GAME, my friend.  It's one of the
few ways left for the average guy to get stinking
rich.  So if you've got a little cash to spare -- and
have a love for tape-measure home runs -- you've got
to check this stock out.

Here's the story.

Gene sequencing and human cloning get all the
headlines, but a lot of the most compelling work in
biotech comes from much more "boring" fields.  This
little company -- for example -- is doing AMAZING
STUFF with common carbohydrate compounds.  In fact,
its experimental drug GBC-590 may prove to be one of
the biggest success stories of the decade.

LET ME STRESS the word "experimental."  It's not
approved yet -- it's still going through clinical
trials.  That's why the stock price is so low...but
that's also why you have a chance to multiply your
investment twenty fold -- if you get in now!

This drug may be experimental, but it's also on the
FAST-TRACK towards FDA-approval.  Management stepped
up the pace of clinical studies after initial results
proved very favorable.

In fact, Phase 1 results -- primarily used to show the
safety of a drug -- showed REMARKABLE BENEFITS against
prostate cancer.  It stabilized or reduced PSA
(prostate specific antigen) levels in 80% of the
patients, with advanced cancer, tested!  High PSAs, of
course, are a marker of prostate cancer -- and a sign
that the disease is spreading uncontrollably.

Today, there is no effective treatment that improves
the survival rates for men whose cancer continues to
spread -- even after surgery.  That's why this news is
so important.  It means new hope for patients who
thought they had none.

AND FOR INVESTORS like us, it means wealth potentially
beyond our wildest dreams.

Remember, clinical trials are still ongoing.  But GBC-
590 seems to work by attaching itself to receptor
points on individual cells, much like the space
shuttle docks at the orbiting space station.  Once
"locked in," this drug thwarts the typical metastatic
action -- that is, it stops the cancer from spreading!

Imagine the wealth-building potential!  But the story
doesn't stop there.

Animal-modeling with GBC-590 suggests a possible
BREAKTHROUGH in the treatment of pancreatic cancer,
which typically has a five-year death rate of 99%!
43% of mice survived past the 43-day benchmark versus
none given the most-commonly used drug for pancreatic
cancer.  And 33% of the GBC-590 mice were 100% CURED
of their tumors!

Phase II trials on human pancreatic and colorectal
cancer patients are now underway.  And any positive
news here should send this stock skyrocketing.

WHAT'S MORE, this biotech is not some one-trick pony.
One of its more interesting developments is CAN-296, a
new breakthrough against drug-resistant fungus,
including Aspergillus and Candida.  Pre-clinical
studies suggest it's very effective and extremely
fast-acting.  Icing on the cake!

I won't claim that everyone should own this stock.
It's an aggressive play, and no one should put a lot
of money in it.

But then again, you don't need a lot.  Just a small
investment now could well mushroom into a not-so-small
FORTUNE over the next several years.  I think it's
worth a look -- and a few thousand dollars, as well.

Strategies advisory and I'll give you this company's

Best of all, when I say a "risk-free subscription," I
mean it.  Try Forecasts & Strategies for six full

money.  If you don't like F&S -- if you're not getting
