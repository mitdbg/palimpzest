This was forwarded to me from a  friend.  Kinda weird.

This is really sick. This is an internet newsgroup where a guy as early as  Aug 31 claims something horrific was about to happen in the United States. Read  this entire interaction between a guy named Xin and a few others. Pay REAL close  attention to the dates of the message and the SUBJECT lines. This newsgroup  thing will probably make the news as early as tonight - so check it out. This  guy was obviously involved or new those involved in the whole incident.
 
This is not a joke. 
 
God Bless the Victims.
