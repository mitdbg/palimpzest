BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EES Europe Clinches Long-Term Outsourcing Deal With Guinness
EES Europe has signed a 15-year agreement to own and operate energy assets =
at the Park Royal Guinness Brewery in London. The deal means EES will sourc=
e gas and electricity to provide steam, compressed air, chilled water and o=
ther industrial commodities to one of the largest breweries in Europe. EES =
will also have responsibility for managing a series of energy reduction mea=
sures at the plant, designed to improve performance and reduce costs. These=
 measures will include investment in new boiler, refrigeration, compressed =
air and effluent treatment plant.

Stuart Rexrode, Vice President of EES Europe, said: "Closing this deal was =
an outstanding effort by the entire team and is another example of the type=
 of innovative energy partnerships we are forming in the marketplace. This =
transaction, coupled with the Sainsbury's deal, has caused the industry to =
start taking notice of EES, and I am confident more customers will be knock=
ing on our door looking for similar structures."

Congratulations to everyone on the team for their dedication!

Enron signs first long-term dry bulk shipping freight origination deal with=
 major Japanese player
Enron's shipping freight team has signed a 10-year time charter deal for a =
178,000 tonne capesize vessel with Lepta Shipping (with a performance guara=
ntee from Mitsui & Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan)   The agreement has a notional val=
ue of USD60 million and a mark-to-market value of USD 5 million.  The new a=
greement gives Enron the option to buy the vessel in Japanese yen after the=
 third year and the time charter period itself can be extended by us by up =
to an additional four years, if required.  The agreement takes effect from =
the latter part of 2003 when the ship itself, currently being manufactured =
in the Imabari shipyard in Japan or any similar substitute vessel, becomes =
available.  "We are already in the process of onselling the first three yea=
rs of our time charter above the curve ," announces Pierre Aury, who heads =
up Enron's dry bulk freight team.  "This deal gives us a strategic long "da=
ys" position and we now expect to close further deals as a result of our dr=
ive to commoditise more time charter transactions."  The team is already ex=
ploring new time charter deals in the scarcer cape-size and handy-size vess=
el market.  A combined effort between the legal, tax, credit, transport sup=
port and structuring teams was instrumental in helping to book this deal ju=
st in time for Q2.  The shipping freight team is already working on a new s=
tructured deal with a major UK bank, so watch this space for future announc=
ements...

Enron Credit Closes Deal with Enron's Shipping Desk
On 8 August, 2001 Enron's shipping desk bought a Digital  Bankruptcy Swap (=
DBS) from Enron Credit in order to buy protection against a Japanese indust=
rial/trading counterparty.  Under the terms of the deal the shipping desk w=
ill receive pay-out from Enron Credit when this counterparty becomes insolv=
ent under Japanese laws and therefore hedges the counterparty risk that  th=
e desk holds when transacting with this Japanese counterparty.  When the le=
vel of the shipping desk's mark to market profit rises above a certain amou=
nt, the desk will also have the ability to buy additional DBS protection.  =
Similarly, if the desk's contract with the Japanese counterparty terminates=
 earlier, the desk can sell back any unused DBS cover to Enron Credit.

"We needed to increase our credit capacity with this counterparty in order =
to do more deals and then realised that Enron Credit could help us," said P=
ierre Aury who heads up the freight team. "Another driver was that we felt =
we needed to set a foot in the DBS market in order to go up the learning cu=
rve and develop shipping specific DBSs for the near future." "The hedge bet=
ween these two commercial groups is another milestone in Enron's internal r=
isk management.  With each commercial group having to optimise its capital =
at risk, the services and tools Enron Credit has on offer are an excellent =
complement to our already sophisticated RAC process," commented Ted Murphy,=
 Head of RAC in Europe.

Congratulations go to Andrew Feachem who originated the deal for Enron Cred=
it and Pierre Aury.
