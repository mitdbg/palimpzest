Sean,

We have our Super Saturday's coming up on Nov 10 & Nov 17.  We need more interviewers for the 10th.  I would really appreciate your commitment for Saturday the 10th.  The day will begin at 8:30 and will be completed by 4:00 PM.  Both breakfast and lunch will be served.  Would you be available for the 10th or would the 17th be better?

Give me a call with any questions!

PS:  Sean (your man from Univ of O) will be coming on the 10th.  You might want to come and root for him!
