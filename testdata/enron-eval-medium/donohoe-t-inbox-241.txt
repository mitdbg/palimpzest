Amber Station is flowing 323 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 129 Mdth for
today.  REGT has lifted its operational alert limiting West of Amber
receipt capacity in order to give REGT some operational flexibility to
better handle system upsets.  However, be aware that REGT is not offering
any general interruptible transportation discounts from West of Amber to
east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate, unless of
operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD and is
approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage facilities.  REGT is also
undergoing some work at its Ruston compressor station which affects storage
ability and the ability  to transport additional IT into the PVH.

Power plants burned at 140 Mdth/d and are nominated at similar levels for
today.  Arkla is only burning around 170 Mdth/d but is expected to pick up
with the cold front coming in over the service area tomorrow.

Gas Prices     East  $2.78
          West  $2.71

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.04476/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.  REGT will be
posting available November Firm Transportation capacity sometime today.

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.
