To my freinds and colleagues:

I have thoroughly appreciated my employment and the many friends I have
made here at Enron. These are tough times, and my sympathy goes out to
everyone.

Should things get tougher still for some of you, I would like to extend
my services as a real estate agent. For some of you who don't know. I have worked as a realtor in
Houston for 6 years. If anyone needs help selling (or buying) a home, I
can be reached at Century 21 (281) 855-6100 ext. 71. Good Luck and God Bless each and everyone of us.

Thank you.

Joe Bucio
