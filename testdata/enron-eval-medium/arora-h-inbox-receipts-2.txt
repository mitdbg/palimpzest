Hi,

	How are you?  Just a brief note to let you know that I followed up on the letter (dated May 2nd) to Dr. Ken Lay from the President of Howard University.

	I spoke with President Swygert and Dr. Hassan Minor about how Enron may assist Howard University in structuring a new Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Center (ISE).

	I was informed that Howard will be forwarding further details onto Dr. Lay and me as to how Enron can help them move forward with the development of the ISE.

	Will keep you posted.

Kind regards,
Iris
