Shelley & Lynn,   Fran has advised me there are no legal problems with schedulers working a weekend shift from 7 am to 10 pm for one weekend day, the other scheduler will take the other day.  Each will be given a two days of comp time as they are today for their two 8 hour shifts. Fran does have a concern of fatigue in the later hours, just a we do.  There are only two team members that are interested in this schedule, so we'll give it a try and let you know how it goes.  Sheila
