Yes, May has been received.  I've tied out the fuel retained, used(slightly off,but that's probably ppa's), linepack sales, & electric fuel.
I'm trying to tie out imbalances.  They are off.  Ken, is putting a B.O. schedule together by contract so I can tie back to the CBS summary report.  Once that's done, it good to go.

I have added the Linepack change to the report, as we discussed in our last meeting. This information is in the last column, column "U", on the report. The cell calculates the change in linepack from the previous day. Linepack readings are taken at the end of each gas day.

Please call me if you have any questions.
