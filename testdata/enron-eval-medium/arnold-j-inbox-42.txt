My email system has recently developed a glitch.  It has come to my
attention that some emails have been sent to me, but I never received them.
When this happens, the system does not return a 'mail not delivered' message
to the sender.  If you have sent an email to me in the last couple weeks
expecting a response, but did not hear back from me or my office, please
call us.  I apologize for any misunderstanding or inconvenience.  Of course,
issues requiring a timely response are always best handled over the phone,
and until my email system is fixed it is best to either call me or email
Rafael (rafael.herrera@ubspainewebber.com).  Thank you for your
understanding.
