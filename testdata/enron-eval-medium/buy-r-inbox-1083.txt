I just returned from a meeting and had a voice mail from Marc Manly (NPW General Counsel) indicating they had a good meeting with Gene Lockhart this morning and were in the process of turning the document around.  The voice mail was left at 11:35 am this morning.  Marc indicated he would try to E-Mail the documents (blacklined to show changes) to us in approximately 1 hour and suggested that after we skim the documents we get on a short conference call with him so he could walk us through NPW's thought process on why they made the changes (and not to negotiate the document on this call).  Marc indicated, for example, that they changed the daily requirement for reporting in Section 2(b) because from a practical perspective NPW could not meet this schedule.  He also indicated that much of their review had been focused on making sure from a practical perspective the documents worked.

I will keep you advised.
Robert
