A pipeline meeting has been scheduled for Wednesday, March 27, 2002 from
9:00am-3:00pm at CMS Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line to discuss FERC Order
RM96-1-019 that was issued on 3/11/2002.

Date:          3/27/2002
Time:          9:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.
Location: CMS Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
          5444 Westheimer, Houston, 77056
          Please check in with the 7th floor receptionist.

Conference calling will be available.  Please send me an email letting me
know if you will attend in person or via conference call.

Also, attached is a document that I sent out internally after the NOPR was
issued late last year.  It was intended as a status report on where we left
off in GISB on the issue of partial day / intraday recalls.  I am attaching
this document as it may be a helpful reminder of where we left off.  The
document also contains links to the GISB EC 12/2000 recommendation form,
the 12/8/2000 pipeline comments, the 12/14/2000 EC minutes, and AGA Reply
to the 2/1/2001 GISB Report to FERC.  Please let me know if you have any
questions about the document or links.

I will be attending NAESB WGQ meetings at CIG next week.  I can be reach at
713-598-2946.  I will also check my email frequently.  Thanks...k
