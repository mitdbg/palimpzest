 =09 =09    Dear Randy,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in =
for Jay Rickerts.   Just a reminder - On Friday, Houston Correspondent Kim =
Benestante is live in Cairo, Egypt covering the OPEC meeting.  Join us tomo=
rrow as Kim brings us the latest on possible oil production cuts beginning =
in January.      We'll also have more reaction from here in Washington to t=
he OPEC meeting.  American Petroleum Institute Chief Economist John Felmy, =
Ph.D., will share his thoughts on the cartel's moves and what they might me=
an for the U.S.  Also during the 12:00 p.m. ET newscast, The Petroleum Fina=
nce Company Senior Market Analyst George Beranek will give us his assessmen=
t of the market if OPEC follows through with a production cut.   The Federa=
l Energy Regulatory Commission has had a very busy year - from the Californ=
ia crisis to the crisis at Enron, the Commission has had a full docket.  On=
 Friday during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast, we'll hear what former FERC Chai=
rman James Hoecker thinks about the past year at the FERC and what issues m=
ay surface during the New Year.   As the year draws to a close, the Houston=
 bureau will take a look back at one of the biggest energy stories - the co=
llapse of the energy giant, Enron.  Houston Bureau Chief Myra Jolivet says =
on Friday, the Houston bureau will review the timetable of Enron's demise, =
the effects of its bankruptcy filing, layoffs and the company's downgraded =
credit rating.    As Texas deregulation nears, competition in the market is=
 heating up among retail energy providers.  The Houston bureau says the Tex=
as Public Utility Commission set the price to beat for areas in the state, =
and competing retail energy providers are beating those prices.  We'll have=
 all the details from the Houston bureau on Friday.   West Coast Correspond=
ent Kym McNicholas says on Friday, California Senator Debra Bowen talks abo=
ut what to expect from the legislature in the first few weeks of 2002.  Kym=
 says possible topics of discussion include the issuance of the state's $12=
.5 billion in energy bonds, the California Power Authority and plans to get=
 Southern California Edison and PG?out of debt.   Also on Friday from the W=
est Coast bureau, California Energy Commissioner Michael Moore talks about =
the gas supplies in California.  Join us for these reports and more from Sa=
cramento tomorrow.    Closing Prices for Thursday, Dec. 27, 2001    Crude: =
