Hi All,

Here's the updated spec document file dated 072701. All the changes discussed in the last meeting have been incorporated. 

 

As mentioned earlier we will start working the Top section - Payroll (Salary & wages, benefits, and taxes) on 8/1/01.
As regards the report specifications for the remaining non-payroll section of the report further review and modifications will be forthcoming based on design analysis to be done by Braden and myself.


Please review the specs with respect to all the sections, cost elements & formulas indicated and let us have your observations.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Regards,

Usha Kumar
