 Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primaril=
y=20
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value. =20

 Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game =
at=20
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use i=
n=20
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.   =20

 Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley. =20
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily =
as=20
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value. =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a=
=20
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven=
=20
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the=20
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotatio=
n=20
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.    =20

 Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He=
=20
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will=20
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positi=
ve=20
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt=20
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder und=
er=20
the current conditions.   =20

 Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injur=
ed=20
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing=
=20
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.    =20

 Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur=
=20
on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rook=
ie=20
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for=20
Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined=
=20
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of t=
he=20
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.   =
 =20

 Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00=20
 Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return =
to=20
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  "Oak," who wa=
s=20
suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy valu=
e=20
as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deepe=
r=20
leagues.   =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00=20
 Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though=
=20
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State=20
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting abou=
t=20
the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn=20
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the ver=
y=20
latest, so add a little "Vinsanity" to your starting lineup next week.   =
=20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00=20
 Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The=20
Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court =
on=20
Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers.=
=20
Hill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights=
=20
this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, giv=
e=20
Hill the start this week pending any setbacks.   =20

 Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for=20
Friday's game against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but=
=20
has very little Fantasy value.    =20

 Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Nash returned to action against the Knicks Wednesday after missing two=20
straight games because of a calf injury.  He didn't seem to be bothered by=
=20
the injury as he scored 14 points and dished off for six assists.  It is no=
w=20
safe to play Nash on your Fantasy team again.    =20

 Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Marshall is recovering from a sprained knee and is questionable for=20
Thursday's game against the Grizzlies.  Look for starters Bryon Russell and=
=20
Karl Malone to play extra minutes in his absence.  Avoid using Marshall unt=
il=20
he appears to be fully recovered.   =20

 Kevin Garnett , F MIN - Farragut Academy Updated 12/07/00=20
 Garnett hurt his right ring finger in Tuesday's game and was scheduled to=
=20
have it examined Wednesday.  He is expected to play against the Wizards=20
Thursday.  Monitor Garnett's situation.  Something as simple as an injured=
=20
finger on his shooting hand could lead to an offensive slump and affect his=
=20
Fantasy numbers.   =20

 Terry Davis , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 Davis will be eligible to come off the injured list Sunday but Achilles=20
tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep him sidelined a little bit=
=20
longer.  He has been injury prone throughout his career and doesn't have mu=
ch=20
Fantasy value.   =20

 Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00=20
 McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday's game against the Heat=
=20
and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against the Magic.  Keon Clark=
=20
will start at power forward if McDyess is unable to play.  The leg is sore=
=20
now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few days.   =20

 Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00=20
 Hill may be ready to return to the court for Thursday night's game against=
=20
the Nuggets. He has missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he=
=20
practiced on Wednesday, and all indications signal his return to the court.=
=20
"I can't give you the official thumbs up," said Head Coach Doc Rivers, "but=
=20
it looks good." Fantasy owners who have been waiting for Hill's return will=
=20
likely get him back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a=20
four-game West Coast road trip.  =20

 Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00=20
 According to The Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful=
=20
that Trent will travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing o=
n=20
the East Coast.  Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but coul=
d=20
be back in action in another two weeks.  He has been sidelined since the=20
first preseason game with a strained upper abductor muscle.  Trent is a goo=
d=20
inside scorer and a solid rebounder but is injury prone.  When he does retu=
rn=20
Fantasy owners should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately=
=20
need a forward.    =20

 Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00=20
 Marbury missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of a=
n=20
ankle injury. He turned the ankle last  Friday night in Orlando, then turne=
d=20
it again the following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is=20
still lacking some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankl=
e=20
is diminishing. Marbury hopes to return on Friday night when the Nets host=
=20
the Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have the=
ir=20
star point guard back in time for next week's roster changes. =20

 Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00=20
 Carter was in uniform for Wednesday night's game against Portland, but he=
=20
didn't see any playing time. "Air Canada" said that he felt well enough to=
=20
play, but team doctors wouldn't give him permission to get in the game. "We=
'd=20
like to have him back as soon as possible," said Head Coach Lenny Wilkens,=
=20
"but we're not going to bring him back before he's ready." Toronto finishes=
=20
their three-game West Coast swing on Friday night against Golden State, at=
=20
which time Carter hopes to make his return. The Raptors' star should be bac=
