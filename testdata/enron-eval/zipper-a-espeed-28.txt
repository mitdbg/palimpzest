Heard the Skilling meeting was postponed.  Here's the redraft of the

Travis:

 Please find attached a clean and redline version of the revised
Exclusivity Agreement, with the changes that we discussed.  The redline
shows changes from the draft submitted to us by eSpeed.

 Per our earlier conversation, you said that Andy was still thinking
about one open point, namely: Whether the definition of the Enron Platform
should be modified to anticipate some changes that may occur.  Specifically
I suggested that the requirement that the Enron Platform be "operated" by an
Enron Party be deleted, and leaving only the limitation of ownership.

 I have given Anthony comments on the series designation.  He will be
making other changes to the designation and will forward it to you directly.

 Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, or if I
can be of any further assistance.

 Best regards,

 Ted
