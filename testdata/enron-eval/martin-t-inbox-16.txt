Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower in Quiet Trading=20

Natural gas for March delivery on the NYMEX dropped $0.043 to $2.074 per MM=
Btu yesterday. The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu. The mark=
et dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the session bet=
ween $2.10  $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as locals sold down =
the contract to the $2.07 support level and went home short. The AGA will r=
elease this weeks storage report this afternoon, and while some traders are=
 predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf withdrawal, look for the numbe=
r to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in the Midwest and Texas, the growi=
ng differential between cash and futures, and the perceived premium in the =
early March contract have kept the market from dropping further. Physical p=
rices retained their premium over futures yesterday on short-term cold weat=
her at some pipelines, maintaining about a $0.07  $0.10 premium over the NY=
MEX. But cash traders expect the demand to ease quickly as temperatures mod=
erate by t! his weekend. As usual, the market will look to the weekly stora=
ge report for short term direction, but it is the massive amount of volumes=
 still in storage compared to last year that has put a cap on longer term p=
rice increases. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada =
was generally flat to plus or minus a few cents yesterday. Natural gas for =
next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.02 to $2.20 per MMBtu.

Enron Executives Knew of Losses

Enrons top executives and board of directors knew as early as March that it=
s off the books partnerships were losing money, according to William Powers=
, dean of the University of Texas Law School who was appointed Enrons board=
 of directors to investigate the company. In testimony before the House Ene=
rgy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that Enron had a $500 million loss =
in March. Rather than report it to shareholders, Enron gave a partnership c=
alled Raptor another $800 million in Enron shares. He said that there is no=
 doubt that almost everyone, from the board of directors on down, knew that=
 the company was attempting to offset investment losses with stock. The par=
tnerships allowed Enron to misrepresent earnings for a period spanning the =
3rd quarter of 2000 through the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers t=
old that committee that over 70% of Enrons earnings for that period were fa=
lse. He said that there were red flags that should have alerted former chai=
rman Ken L! ay to what was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely under=
stood that Enron was using its own stock to offset the losses in the partne=
rships.=20

Reliant Shares Plunge after Delay of 4th Quarter Results

Reliant Resources stock plunged more than 13% yesterday, dropping to a 52-w=
eek low after it delayed 4th quarter earnings and said it will restate earn=
ings for the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2001 to reflect additional profits of =
$100 - $130 million. However, it lowered its earnings guidance for 2002. Re=
liant Resources is 80% owned by Reliant Energy, which also delayed its 4th =
quarter report. Shares of Reliant Energy dropped $1.98, or 8%, to $22.94. R=
eliant Resources said it will restate earnings due to a reclassification of=
 purchases and sales of natural gas and power that were originally intended=
 to be cash flow hedges, but said it now believes the transactions did not =
meet all of the necessary criteria for hedge accounting. Reliants accountin=
g department discovered the error as it was preparing the year-end statemen=
t and brought it to the attention of outside auditors and the audit committ=
ees of both Reliant boards. As a result of the reclassification, Reliant wi=
ll recogni! ze in 2001 earnings that which it had expected to recognize in =
2002 and 2003, resulting in the lowered earnings estimate. The move will no=
t affect cash flow for any period. Reliant now expects earnings in 2002 of =
$1.80 - $2.00 per share, below previous estimates of $2.05 - $2.15 to refle=
ct weak economic conditions and steps taken to strengthen its balance sheet=
. Moody's and S?both said that the announcements would not have any impact =
on the credit rating of Reliant Resources, which was placed on credit watch=
 after Reliant said it planned to buy Orion Power Holdings for $2.9 billion=
. The deal also involves assumption of $2.1 billion in debt which could cau=
se problems in todays post-Enron environment. Reliant has lowered its capit=
al spending budget for 2002 to 2006 by $1.6 billion to further strengthen i=
ts balance sheet.=20

Europeans Trade Enron Debt to Limit Exposure

Enrons European creditors are scrambling to cut their losses of billions of=
 dollars to trading partners and banks across the continent. UK energy comp=
anies are pairing off debts and credits, owed to and by Enron, as they look=
 to limit the losses. Exposures have been exacerbated in some cases by the =
invalidity of bank guarantees given by the group just before it failed in N=
ovember. Debt trading could reduce by millions of dollars the amount of mon=
ey Enron Europe's bankruptcy administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers can reco=
ver as companies try to limit their exposure to the energy group. PWC was a=
ppointed in late November to wind up Enron's European division. PWC expects=
 to recoup only about $100 million from contracts held by Enron Europe's ma=
in trading unit, Enron Trade Capital Trade Resources. Liabilities in Europe=
 would run in to the billions of dollars, PWC has told creditors.  Many cre=
ditors are expecting to recoup little or none of the money owed to them. De=
bt trading ! is legal during administration but has to stop once the compan=
y is put into liquidation, the next stage in the bankruptcy process. The ad=
ministrators are not necessarily aware of the details of the debt trading a=
nd will only be able to see the impact when the company is liquidated and t=
hey try to recover the remaining money owed to Enron. PWC will hold Enron c=
reditors' meetings in London next week followed by an auction of the conten=
ts of Enron's London headquarters.=20

ICE to Move Natural Gas Trading to IPE First

The European natural gas business on the IPE will be the first to move onto=
 the electronic platform of the IntercontinentalExchange following the merg=
er of the two exchanges. The move will likely be done this summer. ICE took=
 over the IPE last year in a bid to create a global electronic platform for=
 trading futures and over-the-counter products. ICE eventually plans to tra=
nsfer all of IPE's business online and away with open outcry pit trading. I=
CE is owned by 100 of the world's largest energy and metals traders, broker=
s and bankers. And, what a coincidence that EnronOnline got out of ICE's wa=
y just in time as it was approaching critical mass. We were just a tree in =
the forest, and then the forest burned down, says ICEs CEO. From hosting 2,=
500 trades totaling $2 billion a day in September, ICE now averages $4 bill=
ion per day and 4,600 trades.=20

Enron Trading Unit May Have Operated in Red

Enron's energy trading unit may have been operating in the red for months p=
rior to its bankruptcy. Enron's Wholesale Services reported 3rd quarter pro=
fits climbed to $696 million before interest and taxes, but its profit marg=
in dropped to 1.6%. The ratio of profit to sales does not include funds bor=
rowed to cover $2.8 billion in daily trades by EnronOnline. In filings with=
 the SEC, in the 3rd quarter, the last period for which figures are availab=
le, Enrons trading revenue rose 54% to $43.4 billion. In July, Enron offici=
als claimed that the trading unit was dramatically expanding and profitable=
. The unit was credited with producing 97% of Enrons 2000 revenue. Enron ha=
d $28 billion in revenue from trading with a profit of $627 million, or a 2=
.2% margin before interest and taxes in the 3rd quarter of 2000. Enron's en=
ergy trading unit had a 1% profit after taxes and interest last year, accor=
ding to estimates. But, since Enron didn't account for the funds borrowed t=
o cover $2! .8 billion in daily trades, profit margins may have been much l=
ower or nonexistent. Enron also had 3,000 affiliated partnerships which hid=
 up to $1 billion of losses and some industry insiders have said that Enron=
's losses may have been too much for any trading unit to cover. One of the =
partnerships bought 14 Enron power plants for $800 million in 1999, using m=
oney that was generated by selling bonds backed by Enron shares. In the 2 y=
ears prior to its collapse, Enron sold billions of assets to independent co=
mpanies and at times for as little as $0.50 on the dollar. In 1999, it rece=
ived $247 million for a London power plant 10 months after opening it at a =
cost of $500 million. Last year, Enron sold Azurix for $1.4 billion after p=
aying $2.8 billion for it in 1998. In fact almost everything other than Enr=
onOnline seemed to have to have lost money over the last few yaers, from te=
lecom to Indian power plants.
