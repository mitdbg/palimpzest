We are actively hacking on PZ and would love to have you join our community: [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1245561987480420445?logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/DNUsemgQ)

[Our Discord server](https://discord.gg/DNUsemgQ) is the best place to:

- Get help with your PZ program(s)
- Give feedback to the maintainers
- Discuss the future direction(s) of the project
- Discuss anything related to data processing with LLMs!

We are eager to learn more about your workloads and use cases, and will take them into consideration in planning our future roadmap.
