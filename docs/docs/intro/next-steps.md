## Goal
This page should guide the reader towards the first page of our user guide (`docs/user-guide/overview.md`), and remove any sense of "unknown unknowns". In other words, the user should have a complete picture of what is left to learn about PZ when they finish reading this page.

It would probably be okay to duplicate a lot of the links in `docs/user-guide/overview.md` right here, so that the user can see what they cover.

- User Guide 1
- User Guide 2
- etc.

Next, the page should link to "barebones" documentation, i.e. the "third-layer" pages which contain class and function definitions.

- `DataReaders`
- `Dataset`
- `Aggregate`
- `Convert` (or whatever we're calling it)
- etc.

Finally, the page should link to the remaining cool PZ stuff, including:

- Our "Cookbook" / tutorials repo (which I will set up any day now)
- Our blog post(s)
- Our talk(s)
- Our research papers
- etc.
