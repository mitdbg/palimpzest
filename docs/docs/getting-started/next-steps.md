<!-- ## Goal
This page should guide the reader towards the first page of our user guide (`docs/user-guide/overview.md`), and remove any sense of "unknown unknowns". In other words, the user should have a complete picture of what is left to learn about PZ when they finish reading this page.

It would probably be okay to duplicate a lot of the links in `docs/user-guide/overview.md` right here, so that the user can see what they cover.

- User Guide 1
- User Guide 2
- etc.

Next, the page should link to "barebones" documentation, i.e. the "third-layer" pages which contain class and function definitions.

- `Context`
- `Dataset`
- `Aggregate`
- `Convert` (or whatever we're calling it)
- etc.

Finally, the page should link to the remaining cool PZ stuff, including:

- Our "Cookbook" / tutorials repo (which I will set up any day now)
- Our blog post(s)
- Our talk(s)
- Our research papers
- etc. -->

Now that you've learned the basics of PZ, it's time to explore topics we've touched on in more detail.

Our [User Guide](../user-guide/overview.md) contains deeper dives into the most important aspects of PZ, including:

- [How to read your own data](../user-guide/dataset.md) (coming soon!)
- [An overview of all operators in PZ](../user-guide/operators.md) (coming soon!)
- [A primer on optimization](../user-guide/optimization.md) (coming soon!)

For developers who are looking to contribute to PZ, we would also encourage you to explore our [full documentation](../api/overview.md) as well.

Finally, feel free to check out other resources on PZ:

- [Join our Community](../community.md) (if you haven't already)
- [PalimpChat](../chat-demo.md) (research prototype of a chat interface for PZ)
- [Research](../research.md) (a timeline of our research papers)
