<!-- ## Goal
This page should provide the reader with a brief overview of the various operators provided to them.

Key takeaways for the reader should include:

1. Seeing an example of each operator in action.
2. Understanding the difference between semantic and non-semantic operators
3. Having a general awareness of the inputs required by each operator (e.g. column specifications for `sem_add_columns()`)

Keeping in line with "show don't tell", this page should have a motivating use case (or two) which evolve(s) in a manner that gradually incorporates each operator one-at-a-time. (If it's too difficult to come up with one example that uses all operators, then try to at least fit the most important operators -- `sem_add_columns()`, `filter()`, `retrieve()` -- into a single example. Additional examples can be created to showcase the other operators.) -->

Coming Soon!

In the meantime, if you have questions about how to use PZ's various operators, please send us a message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dN85JJ6jaH).
