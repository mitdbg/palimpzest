<!-- ## Goal
This page should provide the reader with a brief demonstration of how they can implement their own `Dataset`.

Key takeaways for the reader should include:

1. Knowing how to build a basic `Dataset`: (provide a schema, implement `__len__()`, implement `__getitem__()`)
2. knowing how the data returned by `__getitem__()` can be accessed later in the program
3. knowing how to provide multi-modal input (images must be `PIL.Image | list[PIL.Image]`)
4. Knowing when and how the user can take advantage of an off-the-shelf `Dataset` provided by PZ

Keeping in line with "show don't tell", this page should have a motivating use case and start with the implementation of a simple `Dataset`. The problem should then be expanded to include image and text inputs, with a demonstration of the changes made to the `Dataset` to support these.

I would strongly suggest that we finish with example(s) demonstrating how to use our off-the-shelf `Datasets`. If the user understands (1.), (2.), and (3.), then (4.) will follow quite naturally. However, the inverse is not necessarily true. -->

Coming Soon!

In the meantime, if you have questions about how to read your own data with PZ, please send us a message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dN85JJ6jaH).
