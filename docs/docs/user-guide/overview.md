## Goal
This page should contain a brief overview of what the user guide will teach the reader, with direct links to each section of the user guide.

User guides should probably cover:

- How to read your own data (i.e. custom and standard `DataReaders`)
- How to use each operator in PZ (i.e. an overview of all operators)
- How to use the optimizer (halfway between a light introduction and a deep-dive)
- And more, but let's try to keep the number as small as possible (prevent cognitive overload and reader fatigue)
