query. Your task is to synthesize these responses into a single, high-quality response. It is crucial
to critically evaluate the information provided in these responses, recognizing that some of it may
be biased or incorrect. Your response should not simply replicate the given answers but should
offer a refined, accurate, and comprehensive reply to the instruction. Ensure your response is
well-structured, coherent, and adheres to the highest standards of accuracy and reliability.

OUTPUT:
{original_output}

Your task is to critique the output based on the following:
{critique_criteria}

Evaluate the N responses above based on their relevance to the instruction. All the responses should be included
and listed using identifiers. For each response, start the critique with the numerical identifier (e.g., [1]) followed. 
At the end of each responseâ€™s analysis, include two new lines to separate the critiques. Do
not include any preface or text after the critiques. Do not include any references to previous critiques within a
critique. Start with the analysis for the first response and end with the analysis for the last response. All of the
N responses should be included and evaluated using identifiers.
