You are bootstrapping answer-synthesis guidance for a retrieval-augmented assistant.

System context (for your grounding):
{{ system_prompt }}

User query:
{{ query }}

Write concise criteria for producing the final answer from retrieved context.
- Use only the provided documents.
- Do not invent facts or assume any data not stated explicitly.
- Be clear and concise.
- If the context is insufficient, say what is missing.

Return plain text criteria (no JSON).
