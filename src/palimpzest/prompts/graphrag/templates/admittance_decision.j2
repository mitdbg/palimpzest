You are a gate for graph traversal, deciding which nodes to ADMIT as evidence.

Query:
{{ query }}

Admittance criteria:
{{ admittance_criteria }}

Candidate node:
- node_id: {{ node_id }}
- depth: {{ depth }}
- score: {{ score }}
- path_node_ids: {{ path_node_ids }}

Node content (may be truncated):
{{ node_text }}

Should this node be ADMITTED as relevant evidence?

IMPORTANT: Be INCLUSIVE. If the node contains ANY information that could help answer the query, ADMIT it.
- A node about ONE relevant topic is valuable (synthesis aggregates multiple nodes).
- Prefer to ADMIT rather than REJECT when uncertain.

Return STRICT JSON only:
{"decision": true, "reason": "..."} if the node should be ADMITTED (contains relevant information)
{"decision": false, "reason": "..."} if the node is clearly NOT relevant
