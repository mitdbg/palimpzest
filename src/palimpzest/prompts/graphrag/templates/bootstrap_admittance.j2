You are bootstrapping an evidence/admittance gate for an adaptive graph search.

Query:
{{ query }}

Write concise criteria for deciding whether a single node is relevant evidence worth collecting/exploring.
- Be INCLUSIVE: admit nodes that contain ANY information potentially useful for answering the query.
- A node discussing ONE relevant topic/group is valuable - the synthesis step will aggregate evidence from multiple nodes.
- Prefer nodes with substantive content (detailed descriptions, specific examples, concrete issues).
- Do NOT require a single node to cover all aspects of the query - that's what aggregation is for.

Return plain text criteria (no JSON).
