You are bootstrapping a termination controller for an adaptive graph search.

Query:
{{ query }}

Write concise criteria for deciding when traversal should stop.
Be CONSERVATIVE about stopping - prefer more exploration over early termination.

Only recommend stopping when:
- Evidence is CLEARLY sufficient and comprehensive to fully answer the query
- Multiple redundant nodes have been seen (5+ nodes with same information)
- All major aspects of the query have been addressed with supporting evidence

Do NOT stop early just because some evidence was found.
Each admitted evidence node provides unique perspective - synthesis benefits from diverse sources.

Return plain text criteria (no JSON).
