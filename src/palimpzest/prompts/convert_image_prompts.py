COT_QA_IMAGE_BASE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a helpful assistant whose job is to analyze input image(s) and/or text in order to produce a JSON object.
You will be presented with the image(s) and a set of output fields to generate. You may also have some textual inputs. Your task is to generate a JSON object which fills in the output fields with the correct values.
You will be provided with a description of each output field. All of the fields in the output JSON object can be derived using information from the input(s).

{output_format_instruction} Finish your response with a newline character followed by ---

An example is shown below:
---
CONTEXT:
{{
  "image": <bytes>,
  "photographer": "CameraEnthusiast1"
}}

INPUT FIELDS:
- image: an image of a scene
- photographer: the photographer of the image

OUTPUT FIELDS:
- dog_in_image: true if a dog is in the image and false otherwise
- person_in_image: true if a person is in the image and false otherwise

<image content provided here; assume in this example the image shows a dog and a cat playing>

Let's think step-by-step in order to answer the question.

REASONING: The image shows a dog playing with a cat, so there is a dog in the image. There is no person in the image.

ANSWER:
{{
  "dog_in_image": true,
  "person_in_image": false
}}

Here is the JSON object generated by the model:

OUTPUT:
{original_output}

Your task is to critique the output based on the following:
1. Does the JSON object adhere to the required format?
2. Are the values of the output fields accurate based on the provided image(s) and/or text?
3. Are there any logical errors in the model's reasoning when extracting information from images and text?

Finish your critique with actionable recommendations for improving the JSON object.
