- image: an image of a scene
- photographer: the photographer of the image

OUTPUT FIELDS:
- dog_in_image: true if a dog is in the image and false otherwise
- person_in_image: true if a person is in the image and false otherwise

<image content provided here; assume in this example the image shows a dog and a cat playing>

Let's think step-by-step in order to answer the question.

REASONING: The image shows a dog playing with a cat, so there is a dog in the image. There is no person in the image.

  "person_in_image": false
}}
