# Base classes for building schemas
# - A Field is defined by the tuple: (description, required)
# - A Schema is a set of Fields, but more generally can define a (sub)document
#   - E.g., a schema can define a text file, a paragraph, a figure, a title,
#     a record, an image, a plot, an equation, etc.
#   - A Schema might define a pretty precise object, e.g., "A histogram that measures coulombic efficiency"
# - A DataRecord (see records.py) will be defined by a schema and will have a value
#   for each field in the Schema

class Field:
    """
    A Field is defined by its description and a boolean flag indicating if it is required (for a given Schema).
    The Field class can be subclassed to specify that values of the subclass should belong to a specific type.

    For example, if you wanted to define Fields relevant to indexing research papers, you could define a field
    representing the title of a paper, the year it was published, and the journal it was published in:
    
    ```python
    paper_title = Field(desc="The title of a scientific paper", required=True)
    paper_year = Field(desc="The year the paper was published", required=True)
    paper_journal = Field(desc="The name of the journal that published the paper", required=False)
    ```

    Note that because not all papers are published in journals, this field might be optional (`required=False`).
